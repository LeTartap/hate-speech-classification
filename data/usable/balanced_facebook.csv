"Olympic is one of the most stupid things to keep people busy. So much money and resources are wasted so that some make a few bucks extra, homeless people and street animals be abused, and some idiots carry a fucking stupid torch like morons. I wish that stupid flame does go off!",1
Indians is popular with their stupidity. No surprise here.,1
Obama put Hillary in as Secretary of the state. That tells everyone just how corrupt Obama is. Very like the corrupt lying bitch he choose to be Secretary of state Hillary all Clinton's are extremely corrupt. They and any who back the Clinton's should've been in prison years ago.....,1
I am a Native American Indian and I hate Trump he can sit there and make fun of children and other things he is Cricket he is evil I know we are going to go to war again if we have him I just can feel it now,1
What more do the American people need to understand that what they have is nothing but a corrupt evil system killing their own enemy now just needs to say. ..hold on we don't need to go kill them...their own stupid cops are doing it for us ....jajajaja,1
"I don't care about which president is to blame. I think it's time the ""terrorists"" smashed a few planes into some greedy corporate buildings. Or a CEO was strung up and shot. I'm tired of watching the rich get away with murder (literally).",1
Fucking japs keep killing whales and sharks. These Fucking people are ass holes.,1
"If we the actual people of western countries had been able to vote and decide there is no way we would choose to bomb this country and the poor people stuck there. I hate these so called ""leaders"" for what they have done to syria and other countries alike.",1
"The world is starting to wake up for what the real united states stands for: GREED. This corporate owned country will kill, hurt, imprison, invade, lie, manipulate, corrupt and do whatever it takes for the almighty dollar.",1
But he wants Clinton to win so he is automatically an idiot. Also Jefferson didn't deal with suicide bombings and murderer's. He also didn't have massive amounts of them swarming into countries and demanding Sharia law. Good try but that's a terrible analogy.,1
"When I see stuff likes this it'll actually make me feel sick of the police officers, we all shouldn't be treated in that way no matter if he's pissed or angry, that all hasn't got to do with us..!",1
Dis is nuisance firstly dis child needs a good treatment to cure his injurues but dis media just to make masala newz of it n to get on top newz channels..every one all over the world knows about syria sufferring but dis child should be admitted to the hospital n get good treatment do not follow such newz n gv boosting to such stupid media....guyz show ur is using us...so no comments..,1
TBH Hillary also allowed bill Clinton to Rape 7 women and the. She destroyed them. And back when she was in law she defended man who raped a 12 year old and she knows he raped she allowed this rape to happen and only had the rapist go to months,1
"I have met very few good cops. If they were good cops, they were damn good cops and used common sense and had a heart. The rest (95%) are egotistical assholes who abuse their power and lie worse than the actual criminals. Not everyone is a criminal, but cops treat you like dirt, then apologize if they are only caught. No respect given because it is all a money racket, government income...If you are broke, you are getting convicted. If you have access to money, you can prove your innocence.",1
Piss poor opionion piece. North Korea never stopped developing thier nuclear weapons program and never stopped selling nuclear capable arms shipments. Of course seeing the comments clearly shows people are so stupid as to beleive this doofus.,1
"Again, this is going to stop when black teens stop believing that ""thug life"" is a good thing, when the number of kids in single parent house holds decrease, when they stop killing each other because of gang is a structural problem not a ""racist cop, bad cop"" thing. You morons of AJ+ should share some other facts and not this crap......",1
"I can""t believe that AJ+ is so closed minded media. It just made this news from nothing and made lots of bullshit. Saudi Arabia are not attacking Yemen, Saudia arabia is attacking ISIS in Yemen. Yemen people are living among Saudi cities and there are millions of them there. If Saudi Arabia was actually doing what ever bullshit that this news media are saying, Saudia Arabia would be in civil war. It's such an non sense.",1
"This offends me as a vegan transgender atheist German engineer who vapes organic decaffeinated compressed soy breast milk on the regular and a person who does Indian naked crossfit yoga 5 times per week. I'm also a male feminist and identify myself as a pastafarian Apache helicopter dog who serves only to one master: my chihuahua which I helped cross the border of Mexico because I hate Donald Trump. My dog also walks me, if you find that weird you're an arrogant ignorant homophobic globaphobic sexist.",1
"I hate this stupid video. It highlights all of the bad things that happened, and it doesn't bother mentioning how the students on the bus were being. This lady's life is being ruined because she made ONE mistake. Proves how screwed up this society is.",1
The land of the free! Thank f@ck I do not live there. My heart bleeds for the millions of good honest people. Many of who I call friends. Greatest country on earth???? Sorry I don't think so,1
"People will also remember all this filthy propaganda from the western and american boot licking Arab media! All you pathetic so called journalists and your greedy oil rich mudering, zionist masters have sold your souls to devils just to remain in power. No matter the amount of your fellow Arabs you kill in the process!! You all are equally responsible for what happened in Libya and Iraq. And what's now happening in Syria and Yemen. All you want is to create another Libya in Syria. YOU better STFU and stop pretending to care.",1
"Gulf states need to rot in hell, they have no compassion for their Muslim brothers!! No they are to busy building tall buildings in Dubai and decorating a Christmas tree with 35 million dollars in jewels!! Disgusting and pathetic if it wasn't for the oil that makes them so filthy rich they would be nothing but dirty bedouins!",1
Such a tragedy. Yet another tragedy against the human race. It is so to have a human being like Pope Francis at the helm of the Catholic church. Gives me hope and I'm not even Catholic. Now to have a human being like him at the helm of the USA. Or at the very least not an asshat like trump.,1
Eat it you damn trolls. She has accomplished far more than you couch potato asshats with barely a high school education. Your focus on another woman's body is indicative to your IQ...low,1
Poachers are bad in that africa. We should have people shoot the poachers... 😡 No one is going to stop them unless death is involced.,1
Not sure that syrian govt is the first to blame. Because they did have that much problems before our nice stupid and american as leader) decide give those people freedom.... or it s better to say our view of freedom(a freedom that we dont want). But yes it s easier to blame syrian government.,1
"Listen, this was completely racist and completely out of line. But the people calling for a boycott on Victoria Secret are idiots. An employee in a SINGLE STORE was the one being racist, not the entire company. I've read many articles on this and Victoria Secret sincerely apologized for the stores actions. This isn't the COMPANY being racist. The EMPLOYEE being racist was fired! How hard is that to understand? If you're going to boycott something, boycott that single store.",1
"after looking through hundreds of videos all I want to do is to bring every single dictator or bad president on earth, anyone that takes innocent people's life and put them in one line then shoot them in the head at once no mercy for killers but we don't have the power we're just sheep anyway don't care about my comment",1
"Man enough about that guy, you are the reason he won, he says something once gets played by you people time even people who likes what he said and didn't hear it, will hear it from you guys, so basically you are just indirectly helping him a bunch. Plus I hate the guy but everyone know CNN makes crap up.",1
"Our sacred city, is in Saudi Arabia, (they changed the original name our prophet gave) which is ruled by a base, cruel, corrupt, absolutist, tyrannical, filthy rich, destructive, non islamic clan who only use religion to control the public. They have even bulldozed precious historical and religious sites. I am definitely sure that God Allah will forgive me for my small rebellion against this evil empire. Many other Muslims are similarly revolted by the Saudi regime.",1
From a Canadian point of view Trump winning only proves that your press was inciting the people to be anti Trump and instead of actually figuring out what the issues were and why he was elected the press made it a personality contest. Trump said a lot of unpopular things some racist and stupid but to me he won because he is thinking what the majority of Americans were thinking. Where's my job and where's my standard of living going. It may be wrong all of it but sorry America has been declining for a lot of years the same here in Canada. You allowed corporate greed to outsource your standard of living somewhere else and your elected politicians helped them. So I suggest you give him a chance and stop listening to the news as they only spew the corporate interest. You haven't had good news in about 25 years because the press use to tell the truth now they do not.,1
"I mean just saying. They're probably never gonna see this video so I mean it's a nice gesture but it seems like nothing more than a first world gesture that will only be by other people in first world countries. These kids won't see this but it makes Ronaldo look like a I can't stand people who do things like that. ""Look at how amazing and gracious I am!"" Only people who will notice are the people who aren't in this situation. These kids are busy dodging bombs bullets and gas, not checking their facebooks.",1
"This's the last straw. Constant bullshit on AJ, next there'll be piece on how how telling kids at sports day there's no such thing as winning and losing is beneficial. Yawn, what a joke.",1
People are smart voters when it comes to American idol and bullshit like that but when it comes to an election y'all stupid af,1
"French police are doing the right thing. Germany and France have come under continuous terror attacks and the terrorist have infiltrated the refugees. Plus, the refugees have harbored them among themselves and are in denial for no reason. TIme for both Germany and France to kick the refugees out. THe refugees have raped innocent people, attacked them and German police has been slow in response.",1
"Everybody on stage took it well, except that ahole that snatched the paper out of the older gentleman's hand. Rude. So it was fixed Now ppl are here arguing about it making it into race and all this other nonsense. Y'all didn't get a good night sleep or something?",1
"One of these days, i hope someone will have the audacity to create a cure for stupidity as it has more adverse effects compared to measles and diphtheria! Stupidity is a disease and it has to stop! Stupid people shouldn't breed.",1
Not against hunting but for the love of God hunt animals that are numerous like deer. Leave these magnificent animals especially rare ones like rhinos over. Good on the people fighting to defend these animals. We need them. Shoot poachers on sight. Make the hunters become the hunted.,1
"I googled the names he mentioned. Found plenty of information from the local police, major news outlets (WSJ), the FBI, local news, Wikipedia pages, and private orgs dating back to the times they happened. The local DC department put out a statement with stats regarding most of the kids get returned and a very small end up staying missing. Go check it out. I hate AJ+ lol.",1
"Yet national media blocks this to??? Why?! I am so sick of Obamas racist agenda! They're are how many other ppl in this nation!!! And the (to me) most beautiful ppl, heritage and with more rights! Than anyone here!!! Are hidden ignored? Why Obama??? His bs speech and trying show face what 2-3!times with leaders in that community was a joke! Just like him saying they are only ones has right to say who is and isn't here???",1
"It really is confusing, the situation in Syria as a whole. If rebels are not ISIS, who and how do they get their funding and ammunition from? And if this is a propaganda, where is the other story? I only see coverage of people killed and shunned. It also intrigues me that those (vlogs) all came out all at once as if it was organized in a call to send a message, BE it a message of sympathy or a message of propaganda. It really is hard to tell what is actually happening, but one thing is for sure, the Syrian citizens are murdered by all parties and this war should stop!",1
"What a goddam crime! If there wasn't any oil in the Middle East, Israel would have never have been 'created' in the land of Palestine, displacing 750,000 Palestinians, killing 10,000 more initially and continually butchering more every day. Original backing was mostly the Rothchilds working out of Britain. Now its the USA and Big Oil funded by you, the taxpayer.",1
"This cop is a disgusting pig of a coward and has no place in law enforcement, let alone in a blue uniform that promises to serve and protect.",1
Is there a way I can get all the news from AJ+ excluding Donald Trump or US election stuff? I am seriously tired of this crap...,1
"I do not see how people praying is such a horrible thing, it is horrible for someone to hate people because they pray, this is not Christianity ! Just because you go to church, you make stupid videos like this one, you call yourself a Christian, does not make you one. If you actually followed the teaching of Christ like you say you did, you could not be hateful, mean etc... to any person or living creature.No matter who they are, I am so sick of these so called Christians preaching hate & using Jesus to defend it.",1
"Don't those idiots realise we all originate from the same African ancestors?! I'm so sick of people drawing these superficial distinctions based on race and skin colour! We are all humans. And for the record, she looks JAPANESE ENOUGH to me!",1
Police brutality will never stop until they start taking away these pigs pensions and fire them immediately once they have sufficient maybe we may have a decrease in police brutality.,1
Racist pricks. I on behalf of all white people apologize for those people like these. Not all of us are racist and I can assure you that people like myself would liked to have jumped on that stage to slam dudes head through that podium!,1
"Blowback is a bitch. Maybe the people of France should speak out against their government for sticking their long noses where it don't belong. If you want your government and the arrogant rich to keep getting richer through war and stolen resources, than you're gonna have to sacrifice a few of your average citizens. If not, speak out.",1

"I'm tired of AJ+ hyping up these stories. The driver lost her job, its obvious the behavior is But whats bullshit is this stupid AJ+ who's been endorsed by paid normalizing this behavior by sharing it with millions. These guys are among Unilad, and so many, that could post a banana being peeled and it would get millions of views. Embrace the love, and plant a F'ing tree people.",1
Soon the bill must be paid. AJ+ is a propaganda instrument (FAKE NEWS). What comes out my butt has more resemblence to news than this crap! :-D,1
It wouldn't happen if assholes would stop buying the horns thinking consuming it is gonna magically give them a stiff pecker or some other superstitious bullshit.,1

"If you support women's rights, freedom of speech, religion, and other civil liberties, YET are subscribed to AJ+, an arm of the Al Jazeera media network which is owned by a pro-Wahabi, Sunni royal Family of a nation which systematically persecutes homosexuals, women, and Christians. A nation where Flogging and stoning is permitted, and you will be put to death if you commit adultry with a non-muslim...If you believe in the aforementioned civil liberties, yet subscribe to a network owned by a family which spits on those civil liberties, you're exactly the reason why people see 20something year old liberals as stupid, hypocritical useful idiots. . It's extremely ironic how you willingly consume propaganda straight from Shariah controlled Qatar, yet think conservatives are the the embodiment of the ""ignorant American"" sterotype. Extremely ironic.",1
Well i guess we should now focus on this instead of the fact that the country needs to be fixed off drug dealers... stupid media,1
Weeks-long riots are not a feature of French life. They are a feature of Arab life. This is a racial holy war that has been declared on cucked whites. And if these savages are not sent back it is only a matter of time before we recognize the nature of the war and fight back.,1
"The more I learn about America, the more I hate about their greedy ways. To the white men, enough isn't enough. You have already own territories outside the U.S why must you want more!? You have rob the Native Ricans/Carib, Arawak and Ciboney Indians from the Virgin from Guam from their homes and you have strip them from their cultural. Why must you want more?!",1

"Sadly the power lies in the hands of corrupt leaders be it East or West. Those that do care & have humanity lack the power to help. World is just full of greedy, corrupt evil leaders who definitely see it but ignore it.

"Wow this hurts, but the main cause behind this bloodshed, destruction and chaos are the stupid rebels. If they didn't go out on the streets, demanding that the only hope Syria's got of staying safe and stable to be gone this is what happens. They should've learned from Iraq's mistake. Syria was the only country in the Middle East and Levant region without any debt but the rebels ruined it and the west are robbing its resources.",1
"That moment when Donald has the best answer. And honest answer, and the ""I tell it like it is."" As much as I hate him, he outfoxed Hillary.",1
It only tells us about Americans if their strongest candidate is someone like this sick man. Americans have always had an opinion of not very intelligent people. I was always defending them but this time they proved how dumb they are to be manipulated into supporting him. They are deffinately intelligent people in America who must be now so ashamed of what their country is becoming...,1
Possibly one of the worst things that Trump has done so far is let all these racist bastards think it's okay to let their true colors shine. Welcome to WWII Europe where just walking past a German officer could mean you had to show,1
"Well done, thank you. I have grown up in border town and have always struggled and still do with that Black White thing. Now I'm in Calgary and it's Cowboys and Indians. I try to get along with everyone. I always try to figure out why someone is the way they are regardless of their skin, religion or politics. It is difficult but at least I try. It's those damn Belgians and their stupid EU, that's what I really hate. And Catholics, shite they set the world of science back at least one thousand years. The final solution, educate yourself and try to help your fellow human beings despite one's own prejudice.",1
"The USA is a terrorist, and blabbers in speeches about terrorism. Feminism is sexist, and blabbers in speeches about sexism.

if the raise up and act like them these faggots would stay inside their shitty houses and pray to God to stop them,1
Nasi party do the same thing. Trump most slightly do what he wants. He won't listen to anybody including his General. Doesn't it remind you Hitler doesn't listen to his General during the second world. Hitler also use money from the Jewish that he put in jail. So funny!! History is replaying itself. Hold on to your chair. AMERICANS.,1

"America, America, America.. they call themselves hero but they destroys their peoples culture, life and native people and then saying to our country stop with those judicial killings to our president when their businesses destroys their people's homeland. How hypocrite American government is. To be honest those native Americans are the real Americans. The American government whose stealing lands and killing those nagive people and do it again and again are the real wicked and villains who do it for fheir own greed and selfishness. Thanks to this video it reminds me that I am not still blinded by this government problems of your country hope this natives finds the real justice on their system..",1
Pokemon go is filtering the idiots,1
That's crazy I can't understand how someone can be so money-hungry that they'll destroy the entire planet just for a dollar this has been the case though with a particular people that continue to be money-driven at the cost of destroying the planet but God has promised in Revelations to destroy them which destroy the Earth and therefore that is a promise that will be kept so mr. Money-hungry keep it up and you're just do reward is coming to you in due time,1
All because the western elites decided they wanted to murder and destroy countries for they're own gains... people wake up. Our puppet countries are what causing this!,1

"Ok so let's account for all to blame! My is Isis has bunkers under the hospitals and are using innocent people as literally, human shields! If the world wants to believe we have anymore say about our government then they do... think again! If we had say we would not be in debt... if we had say a rich man would not be our president ! Please don't say we voted him in, here is the deal... we are given a few awful choices between a bunch of people, RICH enough to run. Then they narrow it down to 2 big mouth idiots( both filthy rich) and we are told to choose! Seriously it's like your granny telling you to pick your switch for a whipping! There are so many stupid things going on in the world... I personally have no control over! I am a nurse ... I would be happy to come help these poor babies. My blond hair and blue eyes, among other things would make me a target and I could help no one. Move the woman and children out like the English did ... let soldiers fight out there war and stop being cowards hiding behind children. In addition the bombers all over the world in the "" in the name of Allah "" have killed innocent people! To me it is using God's name in vein and will be punished not praised in the after life! My God is merciful and would not want his children killing each other and then squabbling like children on the Internet! Let's admit none of us have the control we deserve over our lives! I doubt your voice counts to your one bit more then my voice to my government and at some point we give way to just trying to survive and care for our children, praise our God and help others in anyway possible! War in general serves no purpose for the poor.. only rich gain from War. I myself as an American am not rich... I struggle day by day and pray for those I can't help and help those I can. Social media has become a weapon of choice... to manipulate people.. and the truth is no where to be found. The heart ache is never faraway!",1

"I hate this so much. What have we done in the world that makes such a large group of people reject this part of That there's so many people who value something so greatly outside of what they are, and that there's such a big industry off of people not feeling good enough as they are.

"😂😂wtf! People made this video really believe that racism is just words, and clearly whites are not racists! What a punch of ignorant cockroaches lol",1
They even own media houses around the world so not even 10% population can get to know about this.. People need to wake up and realize Israel is a terrorist state and the start of terorrism actually started by the Jews for making money,1
So I don't get it he says he pay taxes but she works at Walmart and she doesn't? Dumb af!! Obviously anyone who works pays their taxes. Is he dumb or is he just being ignorant. 😡😡 why don't he go back to his own country or community and build it to be better than being a racist.,1
India is just another Israel and Kashmir is just another Palestine. India puts blame on Pakistan for every evil in their country. Indians need to take for their actions.

"Please stop with the fake news... everything that the Obama did is getting moved to Obama archives. Stop with the skewed media. People are starting to go with opinion over facts. I'm sick off it.

They have stolen way too much already. Too much. Enough is Enough. There is a limit to savageness and greed. Learn from the Native Americans and their ways, how they believe we are apart of nature not a part from nature. We need values like this for humanity to survive and for climate change to mitigate and stop now.",1

"So angry and sad at the same time. After Rigiberta Menchu and Michelle Bachelet, Dilma Rouseff inspires my life and contributed to my personal beliefs and politics. She overcame prison time, torture and rape under the U.S. backed Brazilian dictatorships. Years later, she became the first democratically woman President of Brazil. Today, Dilma was ousted via parliamentary vote (parliamentary coup) by the U.S. right wing politicians and the business elites. The defenders of democracy (U.S., Obama, Hillary) turned a blind eye as usual. #UShypocrisy I'm trying to be positive, I look forward to Dilma's comeback. The day will come again when she shames all the rich, oligarch, racist Brazilian men back to their neo-colonial White Supremacy caves.",1

The voices were few and were getting less and less by the year, we inhaled tonnes of teargas and broke our bodies from police brutality in protests and noone gave a damn, and then Trump gets elected and all hell broke loose.... sorry to say guys its a bit late now for tears, Trump is the flower of a seed that had been planted decades ago where you were all watching the real housewives and the xfactor sipping on cola and eating burgers when our world was slowly getting taken away.

As the world will one day watch Americas land and hatred burn and sink beneath the ocean deep into the abyss where it belongs.

This seems like a plea for attention; one with dangerous He's feeding off people's and fear to get exactly what he wants, Fame and attention.

I love the message this beautiful lady is giving- she is very right. Her account shouldn't have been suspended that's ridiculous and uncalled for. I am pregnant and I'm going teach my baby to respect all colors and ethnicities that's how I was raised. My mom is a Cherokee Native American- and so is my grandma Juanita. When I was little i hated my skin tone- that sounds weird but I always wished that I could be darker like my mom or my my dad is white- but I respect every ethnicity and color. And it's disturbing to see our soon to be president cause so much hate in this work. It's very scary. I hope I'm not offending anyone,1
From a Canadian point of view Trump winning only proves that your press was inciting the people to be anti Trump and instead of actually figuring out what the issues were and why he was elected the press made it a personality contest. Trump said a lot of unpopular things some racist and stupid but to me he won because he is thinking what the majority of Americans were thinking. Where's my job and where's my standard of living going. It may be wrong all of it but sorry America has been declining for a lot of years the same here in Canada. You allowed corporate greed to outsource your standard of living somewhere else and your elected politicians helped them. So I suggest you give him a chance and stop listening to the news as they only spew the corporate interest. You haven't had good news in about 25 years because the press use to tell the truth now they do not.,1

India is facing this issue since our independence and did so alone - without any assistance. yet, India & Indian Army has handled issue better than that of israel. right now to me, it seems like, your proclivity is towards 'islamic propaganda' the same way most here want. you do that just more subtly. you've just lost that credibility that you had.",1

I remember before US attacking iraq, there is thousands of people around the world got in the race to buy dirham in forex market and started avoiding USD. World bank which dominated by Rothschild really hate to accept gold dinar and dirham, NWO kept destroyed it and created a monsters so called terrorist but the real terrorist is created behind 11/9 tragedy that were lead by US! If US citizens still 'sleep' to stand and fight for the government policy, US will falls down one day. I am a deepest observer about the US policy, i can see USD currency and the people of US will have to fight for the future, the poorest life someday. Wake up & remember, US doesn't have any natural resources such oils/oil palm/Rubber tree/pepper except a soya - the food that caused to breast cancer/any kind of cancer!

Really? NOTHING? That is as asinine as when right-wing conservatives deny that those who shoot up a Planned Parenthood were inspired by their Christian faith. There is a significant difference between generalizing all Muslims as terrorists and acknowledging when religious Faith does influence people to do some pretty psychotic and terrible things. It is been happening for thousands of years and continues to happen. These weren't Atheists that shot up Charlie Hebdo, Or shot up Paris, OR shot up San Bernardino, OR Ran a truck through crowds of people while *literally yelling Allahu Akbar.

They were at a standoff with a MINUTE with him telling him to drop the weapon. This is BS reporting at its finest. Look at the WHOLE video people. It's very obvious he wasn't holding just a book",1
"honestly I will never hug a guy like this even though he tried to a positive message. but, that can't change most people's perception in regard to muslim the question why the suicide bombers are muslims? not Christians or other religious people. don't get me wrong please. muslim brings a lot skepticism to other religious people mind to accept them as moral and sensible human beings.",1
This is organized religion for you. Jewish is not a race it is a religion. They are political on both sides. If your god is superior then you think you are superior. Same for all religions whether people want to believe it or not. All political with religion for the sheeps clothing. This is not our problem it is theirs. Stay out of it because maybe then they will destroy themselves and we can have peace. All this hate and destruction and terror is because of them,1

the world over - the ordinary people get screwed by the rich - and - nothing happens cause the rich own the gov and the police,1

"Ok, I speak as a LIBERAL when I say that I am soo burned out by this religious apologist bullshit. This particukar incident remains cloudy buy I'm sick and tired of hearing EVERY time an attack like this happens, all these jerkoffs, like clockwork, yell that the incident had ""Nothing"" do to with religioun. .... Really? NOTHING? That is as asinine as when right-wing conservatives deny that those who shoot up a Planned Parenthood were inspired by their Christian faith. There is a significant difference between generalizing all Muslims as terrorists and acknowledging when religious Faith does influence people to do some pretty psychotic and terrible things. It is been happening for thousands of years and continues to happen. These weren't Atheists that shot up Charlie Hebdo, Or shot up Paris, OR shot up San Bernardino, OR Ran a truck through crowds of people while *literally yelling Allahu Akbar. So tell me again how this has nothing to do with religion. Until us real liberals are willing to call out the bullshit religious apologetics of the Regressive Left, we are going to be handing our futures to the ignorance of the far-right.",1

"Another attempt of AJ+ to divert its readers and viewers from truth, buy covering just one side of the history and showing interviews of anti israel by ideology. The village in this case is in ISRSEL and is not Palestinians in any border. The population living there is Beduins, they are citizens of Israel since its creation, they serve in Israel Defense Forces and in other public offices. Many of the Beduins in Negev Desert build ilegal and without from national government. Supreme Court rule some weeks ago same demolition to a Jewish build up in the West Bank. Instead of showing the whole picture, AJ+ choose to show lies and divert the viewers to hate Israel and to think it's doing cruelties. Shame on you, AJ +",1

"Has this so called ""man"" been living under a rock, or was he born stupid??? America is a CONTINENT divided in different parts: North America, Central America, South America, Latin America and the Caribbean. The fact that US citizens are called Americans does not mean that the ""United States are America"". What an idiot! America doesn't belong to white men, it belongs to anyone who's living here. It belongs to every single person who is a citizen of this continent. Even though you have referred the US as America, you're wrong. It will never belong to whites! Before whites traveled in ships to get to America, the Native Americans were here and there already. Boy, you need to learn! Gift yourself a History book on Amazon this Christmas! If that is too ""high quality"" for you, go to Starbucks since there is free Wifi, open Google, and start learning about America, and the people like you who have invaded it a long time ago. Here's a hint to start: America before Christopher Colombus!",1

I guess the media is silent about it for the same reason Hillary made the lives of all of Bill's rape victims really miserable. There are rape allegations and shady dealings on both sides and it's really unfortunate seeing how one will end up with extreme amounts of power.,1
yeah... our Prime minister is not a feminist he's just an islamophobe jerk y'all,1

"AJ+ you are hypocrite. You would post a video about forgiveness and another video that entices, and encouraged hate. So Hillary lost, get over it.

Hawaii now looks like a home for merchants and no longer natural beauty. The state of Hawaii should be protected for its natural resources.

"As always those Mfuckers from aljazeera use victimes to create their propaganda. They dont mention that those buses were bombed like they say during a suicide attack (more that 2 by the Rebels.

These buses were chia people travelling from under Jihadi siege to a safer place, 172 killed, 68 children",1
"I am with the Native Americans. Clean water and protecting their land passed down generations is a natural right. Do they (greedy + other greedy political powers) want to steal more? They have stolen way too much already. Too much. Enough is Enough. There is a limit to savageness and greed. Learn from the Native Americans and their ways, how they believe we are apart of nature not a part from nature.

To be fair..most countries have immigration policies. What would Canada do if millions of Americans crossed the border everyday to live in Canada? The only difference is Canada's corporations & politicians didn't offer under the table jobs to millions of people. Now that immigration laws are actually being enforced..it's going to cause pain to people who have lived here & raised families here for decades. This should be taken into consideration. Is there some racism involved.. yes. Not only are the people genetically not European 'enough' but the culture differs. So..a lot of whites won't say it..but it bothers them that a different culture will make up even more of a substantial percentage of American population. Regardless of this every country has immigration policies. America needs to take some responsibility & try to handle this as fairly as possible.,0

We need to help our own first and then help others along the way.",0

The main focus now needs to be on reforming our immigration system so that it is easier for hardworking people to come to the US.

The only way to end illegal immigration is to fix the system and create a more feasible process for legal immigration.",0

Literally never met the man. Or even heard of him before this video. And No regard for how damaging such accusations can be would insinuate such horrible things. I have been sexually assaulted twice and the first time was by a family friend. So I get the whole wolf in sheeps clothing thing. However, accusing someone of something like that or even implicating it is how we have created a society where people are afraid to care for their fellow man. Especially men.

Decimated TANF and Food Stamps, it didn't effect White women, it effected Black women. Hillary was married and still is married to Bill Clinton. I don't see real progress. I saw Philando Castile civil rights violated and the police officer that killed him is still employed with local government. I've seen Keith Lamont Scott killed for nothing too. I saw Eric Garner killed for nothing. I see a lot of Blacks Due Process right violated and the President Obama did nothing to admonish local governments. Our American government is parasitic. I don't see change as President Obama puts it. I mean maybe for him and his family and cohorts. I'm out here struggling to make a dime and keep a penny in my pocket. I'm a Black woman that gets over looked for federal jobs. I've applied for many. I mean what I see is a stark did fence to what President Obama is saying. Not to mention I seen where Whites hated on him and spent 8 years watching Jim Crow media E President Obama and his family. I see African Americans in peril.",0

I have worked in Skid Row for 12.5 years. We need services we need donations to provide these services. 2008 really knocked us down and it has been an uphill battle ever since.

Actually he bought the land for purposes and preserved it. Had he not it would have been sold to dozens of developers who would have divided up the land and killed many species and plants in the process. The Hawaiians mentioned received large sums of money for something they never knew they owned and are still allowed to live on the land. It's actually a lot more complicated than the video makes it out to be,0
Wish there was a link at the end of the video to the full video. I appreciate this being posted but putting things like this out of context doesn't help people speak about politics. If people watch the whole thing they may not have a different opinion about him but will be able to defend their opinions more solidly and defend their values.,0

This made me tear up. This man has such a beautiful heart and he's giving so much of himself to these children in their time of need. I cant imagine how it feels to give so much of your heart and to love these children knowing that he lost many of them. He also lost his wife. He's taking that pain and turning it into something Once in awhile we get to meet or know angels on earth.,0
Such a wonderful man.. I know kids can be tough at times when they wake you up at night. And this guy is doing it single handedly for so many children with special needs and that too are not his own. Can't think of any other deed that is better than this man's work. God bless him and these kids.,0
"This video does not change my mind that people should not enter ANY country illegally. If you think The US is strict, look at Canadas immigration laws.

If you think that immigration laws should be changed, put your efforts towards that... not towards justifying illegal behavior.",0

There are very few people like this man on this earth this level of being selfless is extremely rare a good man with a good heart and a good on life and how death should be handled all people really want is to love and be loved of age I'm sure every single one of those kids are beyond grateful for this man's help glad to know there are still some good people in the world ❤,0

"Getting citizenship is not as easy as many of you think. Couple that with the fact that many immigrants are doing jobs that many Americans won't do, for less than what we'd demand, and aren't covered by FMLA, able to get private insurance, and their employers do not have to meet ANY of the requirements of fair pay, work hours, safe working conditions. All of which are benefits we as citizens have. Yet they're willing to work 12 hours a day in fields, construction, meat processing facilities, housekeeping, while making $2.00/hr with no benefits or coverage under labor law requirements. When I see US citizens willing to work for the same pay under the same conditions, I'll believe that we as a country are willing to let these people go back. Because without them, your produce, meat, building costs, are going to go up exponentially due to employers having to pay fairly and adhere to federally mandated rules. So don't complain when your lettuce is $2.99, lawncare is $250/month, and childcare is over $300/week. We're so worried about how illegal immigrants are taking from us, and what a threat they are, we forget about what an integral part of our society they are. I believe that if you've been here for 30 years, and have committed no crimes, been a productive member of society, you should be granted citizenship.",0

"So here's my point of view as a conservative person, but not a trump supporter. The main focus now needs to be on reforming our immigration system so that it is easier for hardworking people to come to the US.

The only way to end illegal immigration is to fix the system and create a more feasible process for legal immigration.",0

"We elect presidents with the hopes that they will put America and Americans first. Notice here Obama is concerned about Muslims in other countries first. Not just Americans. Trump says Americans first. He did not say only but he did say first. All other countries put their own people first so you best believe we better do the same thing. If you don't believe we should put America first then you need to exit America's soon as possible. We elected a president to be the president of the United States of America, not the world.

It sounds like Trump is doing what other presidents were doing. It also sounds like crossing the borders illegally has ALWAYS had the same risk of deportation if caught.

Nothing to do with religion. by this video you only see what they want you to be seen. Those children are very easy to abused as they can't speak for themselves. There are many sick people who look like for outside as very lovely and careful persons. I don't judge but people who is taking care of those kids should be extra check.

It's probably my favorite number, no it is my favorite number. You know what, it's probably more like the number two but with a lot of zeros behind it. A lot. If I'm being honest, I mean, if I'm being honest. I like a lot of zeros. Except for Marco Rubio, now he's a zero that I don't like. Though, I probably shouldn't say that. He's a nice guy but he's like, on and on, like that. He's like a computer! You know what I mean? He's like a computer. I don't know. I mean, you know. So, we have all these numbers and we can add them and subtract them and add them. TIMES them even. Did you know that? We can times them OR divide them, they don't tell you that, and I'll tell you, no one is better at the order of than me. You wouldn't believe it. That I can tell you.

It sounds like Trump is doing what other presidents were doing. It also sounds like crossing the borders illegally has ALWAYS had the same risk of deportation if caught. It sounds like the were known before they chose to run that risk. It sounds like we all have the right to choose to do what is right or wrong and to live with the of our own choices. I'm glad I'm not the judge. I live in Canada and we are facing the same trouble trying to deal fairly with an insurge of illegals crossing our borders. Can anybody tell me how to correct this differently than sending them back??????,0

People are missing it. They came to America with the attitude of what can we what can America do for them. They adapted and became Americans. Yes we all come from immigrants that were looking for a better life. A better way of life does not include terrorists today.

And I tell them look, we know what 2+2 is. We've had almost eight years of the worst kind of math you can imagine. Oh my god, I can't believe it. Addition and of the 1s the 2s and the 3s. Its terrible. Its just terrible. Look, if you want to know what 2+2 is, do you want to know what 2+2 is? I'll tell you. First of all the number 2, by the way I love the number 2. It's probably my favorite number, no it is my favorite number. You know what, it's probably more like the number two but with a lot of zeros behind it. A lot. If I'm being honest, I mean, if I'm being honest. I like a lot of zeros. Except for Marco Rubio, now he's a zero that I don't like. Though, I probably shouldn't say that. He's a nice guy but he's like, on and on, like that. He's like a computer! You know what I mean? He's like a computer. I don't know. I mean, you know. So, we have all these numbers and we can add them and subtract them and add them. TIMES them even. Did you know that? We can times them OR divide them, they don't tell you that, and I'll tell you, no one is better at the order of than me. You wouldn't believe it. That I can tell you.

"I love how people say come here legally (like if it was easy and cheap), love how they point out my ancestors came here ""legally"" and ""the right way"" but yet they forget to mention that pretty much 18 and 19th century had open borders until they came with the Chinese exclusion act in the late 1800's, then in the 1940's to 1965 hundreds of thousands of illegal Europeans had amnesties to become citizens. But yet they condemn the illegals of breaking the law but kept silent when our president bomb ILLEGALLY other nations ex. Syria. We don't need a wall or deport millions of residents what we really need is a humane immigration policy.",0

I'm positive that President Trump does not have any issues with Immigrants who enter the USA legally and assimilate into the USA culture and abide by the laws of the land. Why don't the Democrats get that?? It's the people who come into the country illegally and especially the ones who do not assimilate.,0
"Trump is just putting what's currently happening into words, it's not as if what he's saying is anything new it's just that people get pissed when something like this goes public. The United States has for a long time Cared only for itself, not that this is a bad thing but the problem is that it involves other's hardships for them to gain. I guarantee that nothing major in the US will change except the smaller issues just to make it seem something is changing but the bigger picture remains the same.

It sounds like Trump is doing what other presidents were doing. It also sounds like crossing the borders illegally has ALWAYS had the same risk of deportation if caught. It sounds like the were known before they chose to run that risk. It sounds like we all have the right to choose to do what is right or wrong and to live with the of our own choices. I'm glad I'm not the judge. I live in Canada and we are facing the same trouble trying to deal fairly with an insurge of illegals crossing our borders.

"So here's my point of view as a conservative person, but not a trump supporter. The main focus now needs to be on reforming our immigration system so that it is easier for hardworking people to come to the US.

The only way to end illegal immigration is to fix the system and create a more feasible process for legal immigration.",0

I get sexual assault is more likely to be cared out by men, but I think it extremely sad that people see someone trying to help children going through such horrible things. And with no proof. Literally never met the man. Or even heard of him before this video. And No regard for how damaging such accusations can be would insinuate such horrible things. I have been sexually assaulted twice and the first time was by a family friend. So I get the whole wolf in sheeps clothing thing. However, accusing someone of something like that or even implicating it is how we have created a society where people are afraid to care for their fellow man. Especially men. Society has created a space for those women who falsely accuse men of rape by convicting and persecuting men for any small act of kindness and nurturing.",0

"This clip is incomplete. I heard the question live. The first part was directed at Ms. May, the second was for Trump. He did answer most of the question after May responded. No matter how you feel about Trump, posting incomplete clips feeds the anti-media furor. Don't do that please.",0
"So here's my point of view as a conservative person, but not a trump supporter. The main focus now needs to be on reforming our immigration system so that it is easier for hardworking people to come to the US. While illegal immigrants may currently be an important part of our labor force, at the end of the day they came here illegally and should be subject to punishment as such. The only way to end illegal immigration is to fix the system and create a more feasible process for legal immigration.",0
"We elect presidents with the hopes that they will put America and Americans first. Notice here Obama is concerned about Muslims in other countries first. Not just Americans. Trump says Americans first. He did not say only but he did say first. All other countries put their own people first so you best believe we better do the same thing. If you don't believe we should put America first then you need to exit America's soon as possible. We elected a president to be the president of the United States of America, not the world. We need to help our own first and then help others along the way.",0
Plenty of Mexican citizens came here legally and hopefully will do good in this country. The others are criminals and need to be treated that way. Obama's or Trump's makes no difference you can't behave here your out.,0
"I grow up in Japan for 16 years and have lived in US for 9 years. I can say, people would pay that much money for fruits because it taste delicious and you can never experience that in America unless if you are super rich and can import food from Japan. but $27,000 fruits is not for ordinary people it's just for rich people. It might sounds ridiculous but Americans fruits/ vegetable tasted like plastic to me when I first tasted in America (now I got used to it and know where to get ok quality of fresh food). In Japan, people put effort and look for perfection for food if they charge that much money.",0
"Who cares that he owns part of it, why didn't the tribes show up to over 400 meetings to discuss the pipeline? Why is it just recently an issue? Why is it when the project is over 90% completed they want to stop it? Sounds like robbery to me, give us more money and we will quit whining.",0

"This video does not change my mind that people should not enter ANY country illegally. If you think The US is strict, look at Canadas immigration laws. You cant even enter Canada to connect to another international flight if you have had a DUI. There are immigration rules for a reason. Why is that such a difficult concept to understand? If you think that immigration laws should be changed, put your efforts towards that... not towards justifying illegal behavior.",0

"What's wrong with what the president of usa said? His country before anything else? For me is a good word and a good goal to start, lets put it this way, how can a country help others without fixing their own issue first? For me trump is the man than obama, thats just my thought..",0

"Based on my over 25 years as a tribal and local government biologist who has obtained dozens of Section 404 permits and completed numerous Section 106 consultations on behalf of my employers for projects that affected up to one half of a river mile on large rivers in King County, WA and cost up to several $ million dollars, I am qualified to say that Clean Water Act Section 404 and National Historic Preservation Act Section 106 *Permitting* for the DAPL violated multiple federal permit requirements. In addition, use of eminent domain is reserved for public projects, not for condemnation of private land or easements owned by unwilling sellers. Therefore, ALL of the so-called permits for this project, even state and local permits contingent on receipt of federal permits, are null and void.",0

Sorry....I think they all get they attention that is humanly possible....Stop with the hate! It has to start somewhere....why not it start with you!,0
This made me tear up. This man has such a beautiful heart and he's giving so much of himself to these children in their time of need. I cant imagine how it feels to give so much of your heart and to love these children knowing that he lost many of them. He also lost his wife. He's taking that pain and turning it into something Once in awhile we get to meet or know angels on earth.,0

AJ+. Really what did blocking the pipeline do? Now millions of dollars are going to be wasted to route around the area; until the pipeline is completed trucks and trains will have to continue to do the job (which tends to have more accidents than pipelines); you fail to speak about the waste water treatment facility that is less than 3 miles for the same waters they are trying to protect. You also rely on people's lack to research evidence based information and studies on pipeline safety. Hmmm seem like another propaganda video to provide more misleading information to the people.,0
To be fair..most countries have immigration policies. What would Canada do if millions of Americans crossed the border everyday to live in Canada? The only difference is Canada's corporations & politicians didn't offer under the table jobs to millions of people. Now that immigration laws are actually being enforced..it's going to cause pain to people who have lived here & raised families here for decades. This should be taken into consideration. Is there some racism involved.. yes. Not only are the people genetically not European 'enough' but the culture differs. So..a lot of whites won't say it..but it bothers them that a different culture will make up even more of a substantial percentage of American population. Regardless of this every country has immigration policies. America needs to take some responsibility & try to handle this as fairly as possible.,0
Black or white or yellow or brown all of us its same as human. Should be treated equal. And its 2017 not world war era again here people killing each other just because different religions and race and disrespect because of the diversity,0

She's for vouchers which is a way to get the public to fund wealthy peoples private school education. I used to be for vouchers as they try and sell it as giving poor kids a chance to go to better schools BUT it is absolutely NOT the case. I did a lot of research about it and ended up changing my position. PLEASE do your own research as it is too good to be true. Poor kids and public schools just end up with way less funding so the poor get poorer while the rich get richer. I'm adding an article called 10 Reasons Why Private School Vouchers Should Be Rejected.,0

"Trump is just putting what's currently happening into words, it's not as if what he's saying is anything new it's just that people get pissed when something like this goes public. The United States has for a long time Cared only for itself, not that this is a bad thing but the problem is that it involves other's hardships for them to gain. I guarantee that nothing major in the US will change except the smaller issues just to make it seem something is changing but the bigger picture remains the same. Changes evolving wage, medical insurance, etc. these are fairly simple problems when you look at the bigger picture but sadly everyone focuses on how changes personally benefits instead of the greater good.",0
This is honestly so sad. Anger doesn't justify the agony of these people. Try placing yourselves in their shoes and experience life through their eyes. We all live in our little lies. This needs to stop. It's scary to assume that there are people out there that have no humanity.,0

"Throughout the past 10 years society made it possible for someone like Donald Trump to run as president. I guess that is the real issue!
