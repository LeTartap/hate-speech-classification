"White terrorism, oh no he's a drug addict or he must be drunk or depressed. Job well done by media on brainwashing the whites and making them psychic walking zombies. Whites have done enough mischief to humanity. India pakistan africa hiroshima & Latinos Vietnamese, Iraq, libya, Sudan, palestine , chechniya bosnia, serbia , Muslims, atleast 20 million people are being killed after ww2 by USA alone. Freaking 14 trillion $ spent only on war in foreign soil in the last 3 decades by USA . those innocent lives are all someones father's mothers sons daughters brothers sisters grand parents uncles and aunts. Why does whites always wanna go fishing in poor man's water and steal their fish ?",1

"Okay, I somehow believe that the attackers were terrorists, aj+ is a biased channel? Fine. How the heck can you justify killing of an eleven year old with pellets, how would you justify blinding thousands of kashmiris? How can you deny their right to move freely and protest for whatever they want ? I am clueless but whatever you say, I have my common sense so whatever reason you indians have for killings and injuring people of Kashmir, it's senseless and goddamn fake And for the guy who said they'll take Balochistan as they took bangladesh and Kashmir : bitch come give it a try, we'll cut your balls and choke you with you ballsack, kashmir is an matter, but when you talk of our land, we'll rip your intestines out of you and shove them up your ass, bitch come give it a try?",1
Wow mark way to be a douche!! Why don't you take a stand and fight for these people instead of stealing their land for your own selfish use!,1
"I like how the president just reads the facts as if it's nothing. Thanks for the problem sherlock, it's not as if we didn't know it was there. Where's the solution? All I hear is ""mass shootings this"" and ""mass killings that"" how about let's stop the problem, cause it's nothing new it's been happening for AGES, how about we come up with a proper solution. All cops that have killed blacks and whites for unjustified reasons should be put on trial and or should not be allowed to be on the police force anymore. Simples. I don't believe they should be put to death or anything, cause it makes us no better but still a punishment for those cops is more than overdue. Let's get rid of those scumbags first before proceeding to other actions. Can't believe it's so hard for a politican or a member of government to deal with it properly.",1
"Im so sick of this channel reporting news partially. The US is conducting attacks too, terrorists are striking West Aleppo too. Aleppo is split (West and East Aleppo) the West is controlled by the government and the East by terrorists (The Nusra Front which are basically Al Qaeda and they're being funded by the US and others). 200,000 currently live in the East side, and thousands fled to the Western side for safety (even those ""against"" Bashar). Al Nusra Front threatened civilians that if they flee they'll kill them, and therefore they're using them as human why so many are getting killed by government airstrikes that are aiming at these terrorists but the media doesnt want you to know that. Those in the West are safer than those in the East, but MANY still got killed by US airstrikes and the terrorists as well and this is rarely reported. 90% of internally displaced refugees of Syria (7million) have fled to areas controlled by the government! So much doesnt get reported on the news and there's SO MUCH BIAS especially on AJ+ videos on Aleppo and Syria. The government does have some blood on its hands yes, but so much destruction and death have been caused by the US, and others who are funding different groups to destroy the country that was once known as the Cradle of A country where everyone lived in peace, a country that was the 4th safest in the world... It was modernized and progressive, and everything was getting better and look at it now. My country is destroyed because of greedy nations. You're also not reporting other serious events happening in Syria including its capital Damascus, in the last 2 days there have been several bombs and one of the symbols of the city, the Damascene Sword Monument, has been destroyed. Stop believing everything you see on the media, it's much more than that. Get reliable sources. I'm Syrian, most of my family is in Damascus but we have friends in Aleppo too. I am by no way saying I support the government, but I am DEFINITELY not with any other group especially terrorists who have ravaged my country.",1

The voices were few and were getting less and less by the year, we inhaled tonnes of teargas and broke our bodies from police brutality in protests and noone gave a damn, and then Trump gets elected and all hell broke loose.... sorry to say guys its a bit late now for tears, Trump is the flower of a seed that had been planted decades ago where you were all watching the real housewives and the xfactor sipping on cola and eating burgers when our world was slowly getting taken away. Obama dropped a bomb every 3 hours in 2016, police brutality was the worst i have seen in the U.S than any other time. Exactly how was he better? Did he fight No.",1

All political of course! I hate that the government plays with the lives of the people regularly for their agendas. They just bought the democratic side more votes. Sad thing is they don't care about anyone in this country.,1
It's amazing how blatant the control corporate America has over that and other countries. They don't even try to hide what they are doing.

War is money and for the Rothschilds Rockefellers DuPont's Saudi Leaders etc of this world because all death leads to their profits. Destroy these families and not families who have no power and then the world can wake up and stop this senseless killing.,1
He didn't mean it ! He messed up lolz. But I can't blame him. In a great country like America we have too many educated ass holes voting for a joke like trump. Everyone must unite and defeat the biggest threat to this country. Obama gotta do everything in his power to stop Donald Drumpf,1

If there wasn't any oil in the Middle East, Israel would have never have been 'created' in the land of Palestine, displacing 750,000 Palestinians, killing 10,000 more initially and continually butchering more every day. Original backing was mostly the Rothchilds working out of Britain. Now its the USA and Big Oil funded by you, the taxpayer.",1

The difference is that idiots who shoot up a school or theatre aren't acting as part of a larger organisation with a political or religious agenda. There is a huge difference between a large scale killing- like the Sandy Hook school shooting- and even a small scale terrorist attack- like the British soldier who was beheaded in London. The school shooting was done for attention- as there was a lack of any intended gain- but the man who was beheaded was done in an attempt to begin a Muslim uprising in London. It's just not accurate to suggest that any large killing is a terrorist attack and blatantly ignores any definition of the word.,1

"AJ+ saying ""all white people are racist"" is a lie? AJ+ normally pushes a racist agenda against whites, this is unexpected. Too bad it falls upon deaf ears as their bigoted fans spew their racist lies about whites and myths like white privilege. Rather than own up to the fact that THEIR bigotry hurts white people just like the racist stereotypes of other races hurt them, they cower behind lies, hate groups like Black Lives Matter, and blaming everything on one man that is nowhere near racist. AJ+, you had a decent start with actually admitting the prejudice towards whites exist, but then you biffed it by ignoring the problem and turning to blame it all on Trump, which is racist and ignorant. Media sources like you are far more racist and bigoted than Trump has ever been. He may be an idiot, but blaming everything on him and ignoring the racism and corruption of Hillary and the left, is downright ignorant.",1

It's not about religion. It's about Zionist having power. Because Palestine was not your first choice was it. It was a country in South America right?? You ""as a pretend nation"" if you where legal opposition would not have lasted, you rule unarmed ( except with stones and pebbles, stop 1000 year old homes and graves there would not be that many stones) Where are your or all that support you in the world are going to hide from your creator?? Really, God told you to kill everyone you killed in the world. You were once the chosen ones, only because Moses (PBUH) was beloved to him and was calling to the one and only. And the Pharo needed to be stopped... God created humanity not so that the Israelis to take it. One day the table will turn, it's predicted and deep inside you and all of you know this. Let's see how it will feel being on the receiving end. Your not of the Jewish faith you belong to a political Zionist movement. Nothing holy about your path.",1
This piece is a heaping pile of BULLSHIT. I live a street away from Alliance Recycling in Oakland and it has caused nothing but problems. All the crackheads that recycle just support the crack dealers on our street. Don't get me wrong these aren't your normal dealers. Just two weeks ago got into a gun fight outside my house with AR-15's AND pistols. Shot the whole god damn block up. While there's baby's in these house's. The dealers they support constantly harass everyone on this street. I can't wait until Alliance shuts down for good. Also the shut down was forced by a police not by the local people.

This is a time where we don't see a persons faith nor there race nor there background this is a time we see them as human beings. This is a time we stand up and fight the corrupt this is a time we stand up and fight corporate greed, This is a time we have to stand up and at least try and save our fellow brothers and sisters in Syria. This is not there war this is not our war this is a proxy war between corporate giants for huge marginal profit and to see who has the biggest balls. At this point race and faith is At this point they are human and we should save our fellow humans from other humans sad to say.",1

"Im so sick of this channel reporting news partially. The US is conducting attacks too, terrorists are striking West Aleppo too. Aleppo is split (West and East Aleppo) the West is controlled by the government and the East by terrorists (The Nusra Front which are basically Al Qaeda and they're being funded by the US and others). 200,000 currently live in the East side, and thousands fled to the Western side for safety (even those ""against"" Bashar). Al Nusra Front threatened civilians that if they flee they'll kill them, and therefore they're using them as human why so many are getting killed by government airstrikes that are aiming at these terrorists but the media doesnt want you to know that. Those in the West are safer than those in the East, but MANY still got killed by US airstrikes and the terrorists as well and this is rarely reported. 90% of internally displaced refugees of Syria (7million) have fled to areas controlled by the government! So much doesnt get reported on the news and there's SO MUCH BIAS especially on AJ+ videos on Aleppo and Syria. The government does have some blood on its hands yes, but so much destruction and death have been caused by the US, and others who are funding different groups to destroy the country that was once known as the Cradle of A country where everyone lived in peace, a country that was the 4th safest in the world... It was modernized and progressive, and everything was getting better and look at it now. My country is destroyed because of greedy nations. You're also not reporting other serious events happening in Syria including its capital Damascus, in the last 2 days there have been several bombs and one of the symbols of the city, the Damascene Sword Monument, has been destroyed. Stop believing everything you see on the media, it's much more than that. Get reliable sources. I'm Syrian, most of my family is in Damascus but we have friends in Aleppo too.

"Im so sick of this channel reporting news partially. The US is conducting attacks too, terrorists are striking West Aleppo too. Aleppo is split (West and East Aleppo) the West is controlled by the government and the East by terrorists (The Nusra Front which are basically Al Qaeda and they're being funded by the US and others). 200,000 currently live in the East side, and thousands fled to the Western side for safety (even those ""against"" Bashar). Al Nusra Front threatened civilians that if they flee they'll kill them, and therefore they're using them as human why so many are getting killed by government airstrikes that are aiming at these terrorists but the media doesnt want you to know that. Those in the West are safer than those in the East, but MANY still got killed by US airstrikes and the terrorists as well and this is rarely reported. 90% of internally displaced refugees of Syria (7million) have fled to areas controlled by the government! So much doesnt get reported on the news and there's SO MUCH BIAS especially on AJ+ videos on Aleppo and Syria. The government does have some blood on its hands yes, but so much destruction and death have been caused by the US, and others who are funding different groups to destroy the country that was once known as the Cradle of A country where everyone lived in peace, a country that was the 4th safest in the world... It was modernized and progressive, and everything was getting better and look at it now. My country is destroyed because of greedy nations. You're also not reporting other serious events happening in Syria including its capital Damascus, in the last 2 days there have been several bombs and one of the symbols of the city, the Damascene Sword Monument, has been destroyed. Stop believing everything you see on the media, it's much more than that. Get reliable sources. I'm Syrian, most of my family is in Damascus but we have friends in Aleppo too. I am by no way saying I support the government, but I am DEFINITELY not with any other group especially terrorists who have ravaged my country.",1

Not one United Air employee helped her even after seeing her in a wheelchair and looking very weak. She finally found out she had to stay overnight and no vouchers were given. They said they weren't required to do so. I had to book her a hotel that was 40 minutes away and she had to go there by taxi and it was after midnight. I HATE UNITED for treating her that way!!! No airline should be allowed to overbook a flight. Flying is no longer It is stressful. The airlines are creating this chaos. I would've flipped out myself if they told me I had to get off the plane after I boarded and was seated. Don't overbook, make sure your have ample seats for your crew to fly if needed.

You look stupid trying to make a comparison between the two because they have nothing to do with each other. My tax dollars aren't spent on people in the streets to protect me. My tax dollars are used for the police to protect me. And black on black crime is no different than white on white crime. People try and use black on black crime like its something out of the norm. White people kill just as many white people as blacks kill blacks. The media won't tell you that though. Crimes that happen within the same race are always higher because the in which they take place are primarily made up of the same race of people. It doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure it out.",1

Disgusting. I thought cops were supposed to educated these days. I thought a high school diploma was no longer adequate. So what gives? I'll tell you. The recruitment part of the police service looks for particular type of person. And too often these days it seems they are purposely recruiting those self centred ego maniacs we all went to school with. Nowadays we'd call them bullies. So why are we arming them? These ego driven trigger happy asshats should be doing security at Walmart and NOTHING ELSE. Hire the right cops. Hire SMART cops. Change the system for the better.,1

Aleppo is split (West and East Aleppo) the West is controlled by the government and the East by terrorists (The Nusra Front which are basically Al Qaeda and they're being funded by the US and others). 200,000 currently live in the East side, and thousands fled to the Western side for safety (even those ""against"" Bashar). Al Nusra Front threatened civilians that if they flee they'll kill them, and therefore they're using them as human why so many are getting killed by government airstrikes that are aiming at these terrorists but the media doesnt want you to know that. Those in the West are safer than those in the East, but MANY still got killed by US airstrikes and the terrorists as well and this is rarely reported. 90% of internally displaced refugees of Syria (7million) have fled to areas controlled by the government! So much doesnt get reported on the news and there's SO MUCH BIAS especially on AJ+ videos on Aleppo and Syria. The government does have some blood on its hands yes, but so much destruction and death have been caused by the US, and others who are funding different groups to destroy the country that was once known as the Cradle of A country where everyone lived in peace, a country that was the 4th safest in the world... It was modernized and progressive, and everything was getting better and look at it now. My country is destroyed because of greedy nations. You're also not reporting other serious events happening in Syria including its capital Damascus, in the last 2 days there have been several bombs and one of the symbols of the city, the Damascene Sword Monument, has been destroyed. Stop believing everything you see on the media, it's much more than that. Get reliable sources. I'm Syrian, most of my family is in Damascus but we have friends in Aleppo too. I am by no way saying I support the government, but I am DEFINITELY not with any other group especially terrorists who have ravaged my country.",1

I just find it so hard to believe how so many people try to give excuses on the behavior of the policeman in video! Pushing around another person and making fun of anyone shouldn't be tolerated and every worse it should never be excused. I'm not saying all the French police act like that! But stop defending the behavior of those two that obviously we're acting in a disgusting manner.,1
The difference is that idiots who shoot up a school or theatre aren't acting as part of a larger organisation with a political or religious agenda. There is a huge difference between a large scale killing- like the Sandy Hook school shooting- and even a small scale terrorist attack- like the British soldier who was beheaded in London. The school shooting was done for attention- as there was a lack of any intended gain- but the man who was beheaded was done in an attempt to begin a Muslim uprising in London. It's just not accurate to suggest that any large killing is a terrorist attack and blatantly ignores any definition of the word.,1

"I don't get it. If you want to be racist you should be treated like the animal you are. Like seriously. It's the same as being religious. I think if you are racist you shouldn't be allowed the privledges others have. Like food and water. Most likely obtained or maintained by someone of another race as you. If you are religious all things science should be taken from you. You have a god you don't need food, water, electricity or medicine/ doctors.",1

"I hate how easy it is for white people to look at these videos and pictures and feel sorry as long as everything happens far away from our comfort zone . How about we all use this fucking white privilege to change the way we think and those that are guilty of these in the first place because most of this is on us to blame, besides just sitting in our comfort western homes praying for a fucking miracle. I bet most of us europeans and americans would be out in the streets outraged if the images were those of white kids. But oh well prayer might do the job, and hope noone attacks a white country cause then we just love to call airstrikes on these very same people we see here.",1

"Boycott United!!! It's as simple as that. It will surely drive the message home because United is all about the money. My daughter was flying from Arkansas to Colorado then to Spokane. She had surgery due to a boating accident. She was flying alone and in a wheelchair at the airport in Colorado. We flew up to Spokane to pick her up. There were so many delays in Colorado. Not one United Air employee helped her even after seeing her in a wheelchair and looking very weak. She finally found out she had to stay overnight and no vouchers were given. They said they weren't required to do so. I had to book her a hotel that was 40 minutes away and she had to go there by taxi and it was after midnight. I HATE UNITED for treating her that way!!! No airline should be allowed to overbook a flight. Flying is no longer It is stressful. The airlines are creating this chaos. I would've flipped out myself if they told me I had to get off the plane after I boarded and was seated. Don't overbook, make sure your have ample seats for your crew to fly if needed. I will never fly United again.",1

Instead of focusing on what a great concept this is, the fact that the president of the club herself said, ""Any woman can join"" regardless of race just further proves it. Imagine another biker club that just so happened to be all white or all Mexican and that was posted in the caption. People would be going off about that. How about we protest an edit to have it say all-female? It just leads us into unnecessary racial tension. For what? More comments? More attention? I hate shitty media outlets but I love what this club is doing! ‚ù§",1
Where were these assholes when the cops shot and killed the unarmed black people? I'm not against revenge but to do it right you have to get exactly the people not people who might be similar. Isn't it sad that the cops who killed those people are watching these good cops get killed?,1

They even own media houses around the world so not even 10% population can get to know about this.. People need to wake up and realize Israel is a terrorist state and the start of terorrism actually started by the Jews for making money,1
I hate Israeli government but imagine you are a nonmuslim and you happen to live near a mosque. They will wake you up everyday around 4 or 5am !!! It's a big pain in the neck. Brings back memories of living in Iran back in the day.,1

"I agree with most of these comments. The only chance that the planet has of surviving is if some apocalyptic event wipes out the majority of people, and some sort of arc is created beforehand which contains the DNA of every plant and animal in existence, and scientists with the right knowledge of reproducing them are left alive to rebuild the world after said event. I saw it in a vivid dream a while back so I won't be surprised if it happens. We should prepare for it just in case. It is unrealistic to think that people can keep reproducing at such high rates, with the pollution and that they cause and pipelines being built and natural resources being used up instead of seeking plus global warming, and greed and corruption and selfish pursuits being the most important things in life. Instead of caring for the planet and animals and being at peace with one another we just fight and destroy everything for money or pride. Something has to give eventually, and we should prepare for it if we haven't already. Who knows, maybe there are people out there in bunkers who are almost ready to set forth the apocalypse to save the planet. If not, there should be. We can't rely on colonizing another planet, we already have one that is inhabitable, we're just destroying it. So people should really prepare a backup plan that's more realistic and achievable than going to Mars or another planet. It's just common sense.",1

Nothing to do with religion. by this video you only see what they want you to be seen. Those children are very easy to abused as they can't speak for themselves. There are many sick people who look like for outside as very lovely and careful persons. I don't judge but people who is taking care of those kids should be extra check. There are so many children abused and mishandled every day....only we don't see or hear it...but it's happening.

I guarantee that nothing major in the US will change except the smaller issues just to make it seem something is changing but the bigger picture remains the same.

"That is untrue. Google search relisha her name relisha rudd turms up many articles. And you can go onto FBI stats for missing persons every year. Yes certain cases seem to get a lot pf media attention. It's usually though not race. In Natalie Holloways case she vanished while on a high school trip in a foreign country. Her suspected killer walked and killed another girl later her parents were very active in her case and made numerous media outlets twll their story. In the case of Chandry Levy also a top Google serch, was killed by her scumbag boyfriend politician and he got away with it. In the case of Relisha. The last day she was seen 2-2614. She was not reported missing until 3-1_14. On 3-25_14 FBI offers 25k reward. Relisha disappeared and the people she was with ""the janitor amd his wife sold her"". Her mother sold her to the janitor. Sex trafficking is real and more kids disappear from homeless shelters, through CPS, churches and the very established to protect them than are even reported. In other countries parents sell kids to pay debts. It is similar here but not discussed. Remember some one has to report a child missing first. Children run away from Foster Care and a "" parent "" won't report them missing so they can still collect a check for them. We live in a sick world, yes independent sick people commit horrible acts. But the bigger problem and the larger numbers of kids "" missing "" are those that society never hears about. We don't want to face the fact that churches sell children. We don't want to admit that pizzagate is real. I conclude by saying that any child missing should hold the highest priority in our police force and in our community. But they are not. Who is still looking for Relisha? Even the Holloways and Levy family have had to hire PI and do their own research and yet they still have no answers, no justice.",0

"I think the reason for the negative comments are experiences of abuse, hearing stories of abuse constantly, and the fact that people from the middle east are painted as evil terrorists. I can understand if an individual who didn't have a happy childhood or didn't have a close and healthy with their parents, especially with their fathers can have this unsettling view of this guy. That being said, I don't think this man deserves that kind of attitude or treatment. He's performing a kindness so rare to be honest my own brain had trouble registering and I find that sad. The video even says it, these kids aren't adopted because no one wants to deal with death; to care, nurture, and love a sweet little soul knowing they're going to die is not something a lot of people want to deal with but he's doing it because someone has to care for them. They deserve a warm homemade meal, kisses when they're sad, to laugh and to be tucked in nicely in a soft and warm bed. Even if they're going to live for one more month, and I find it more upsetting that people condemn him instead of realizing how many foster kids have probably died without knowing that love. It's bad enough healthy foster kids have a low probability of adoption, these sick kids have an even lower chance. I get it, people have glimpsed evil but I like to believe people are innocent until proven guilty. Personally I don't believe he is a sick man to want to hurt these kids; you don't want attention on you when you want to hurt someone, you want to remain hidden and anonymous and he's fostered 40 kids and buried 10, that leaves 30 children and probably a handful would say something if he did abuse them.",0
"Also realize that these people were caught doing illegal activities in order to get caught, and chose deportation, rather than remaining in a detention center. Also, this is getting out of hand.

To be fair..most countries have immigration policies. What would Canada do if millions of Americans crossed the border everyday to live in Canada? The only difference is Canada's corporations & politicians didn't offer under the table jobs to millions of people. Now that immigration laws are actually being enforced..it's going to cause pain to people who have lived here & raised families here for decades. This should be taken into consideration. Is there some racism involved.. yes. Not only are the people genetically not European 'enough' but the culture differs. So..a lot of whites won't say it..but it bothers them that a different culture will make up even more of a substantial percentage of American population. Regardless of this every country has immigration policies. America needs to take some responsibility & try to handle this as fairly as possible.,0

I saw Philando Castile civil rights violated and the police officer that killed him is still employed with local government. I've seen Keith Lamont Scott killed for nothing too. I saw Eric Garner killed for nothing. I see a lot of Blacks Due Process right violated and the President Obama did nothing to admonish local governments. Our American government is parasitic. I don't see change as President Obama puts it. I mean maybe for him and his family and cohorts. I'm out here struggling to make a dime and keep a penny in my pocket. I'm a Black woman that gets over looked for federal jobs. I've applied for many. I mean what I see is a stark did fence to what President Obama is saying.

It sounds like Trump is doing what other presidents were doing. It also sounds like crossing the borders illegally has ALWAYS had the same risk of deportation if caught.

People are missing it. They came to America with the attitude of what can we what can America do for them. They adapted and became Americans.

You also rely on people's lack to research evidence based information and studies on pipeline safety. Hmmm seem like another propaganda video to provide more misleading information to the people.,0

The only thing they compensated the family would be let them sit together in the next flight, not even talking about upgrading them. They were informed 30 mins before boarding.

And for some of the white girls it's there rich parents who pay for the air time and the adds and websites that talk about them. While everyone should get as much attention as the next when something like this happens its not just black girls who don't. There are lots of young white girls, hispanic, and all other races that don't get the attention because they aren't rich or have a beautiful face. In all reality less than a quarter of the females in this country that go missing will ever be heard of. Stop making it about race and make it what it is, it's only the rich ppl who get the media attention and not every white person is.",0

"What about this man makes his ""energy"" feel bad? Why does this ""just feel wrong"" Would the energy be different if it were a woman? Specifically what's wrong? I keep seeing people say this. I get sexual assault is more likely to be cared out by men, but I think it extremely sad that people see someone trying to help children going through such horrible things. And with no proof. Literally never met the man. Or even heard of him before this video. And No regard for how damaging such accusations can be would insinuate such horrible things. I have been sexually assaulted twice and the first time was by a family friend. So I get the whole wolf in sheeps clothing thing. However, accusing someone of something like that or even implicating it is how we have created a society where people are afraid to care for their fellow man. Especially men. Society has created a space for those women who falsely accuse men of rape by convicting and persecuting men for any small act of kindness and nurturing.",0

To be fair..most countries have immigration policies. What would Canada do if millions of Americans crossed the border everyday to live in Canada? The only difference is Canada's corporations & politicians didn't offer under the table jobs to millions of people. Now that immigration laws are actually being enforced..it's going to cause pain to people who have lived here & raised families here for decades. This should be taken into consideration. Is there some racism involved.. yes. Not only are the people genetically not European 'enough' but the culture differs. So..a lot of whites won't say it..but it bothers them that a different culture will make up even more of a substantial percentage of American population. Regardless of this every country has immigration policies. America needs to take some responsibility & try to handle this as fairly as possible.,0

"Getting citizenship is not as easy as many of you think. Couple that with the fact that many immigrants are doing jobs that many Americans won't do, for less than what we'd demand, and aren't covered by FMLA, able to get private insurance, and their employers do not have to meet ANY of the requirements of fair pay, work hours, safe working conditions. All of which are benefits we as citizens have. Yet they're willing to work 12 hours a day in fields, construction, meat processing facilities, housekeeping, while making $2.00/hr with no benefits or coverage under labor law requirements. When I see US citizens willing to work for the same pay under the same conditions, I'll believe that we as a country are willing to let these people go back. Because without them, your produce, meat, building costs, are going to go up exponentially due to employers having to pay fairly and adhere to federally mandated rules. So don't complain when your lettuce is $2.99, lawncare is $250/month, and childcare is over $300/week.

They deserve a warm homemade meal, kisses when they're sad, to laugh and to be tucked in nicely in a soft and warm bed. Even if they're going to live for one more month, and I find it more upsetting that people condemn him instead of realizing how many foster kids have probably died without knowing that love. It's bad enough healthy foster kids have a low probability of adoption, these sick kids have an even lower chance. I get it, people have glimpsed evil but I like to believe people are innocent until proven guilty. Personally I don't believe he is a sick man to want to hurt these kids; you don't want attention on you when you want to hurt someone, you want to remain hidden and anonymous and he's fostered 40 kids and buried 10, that leaves 30 children and probably a handful would say something if he did abuse them.",0

Yeah! Remember America is a whole continent from south to north.Most people from the old continent came to USA. natives and indigenous from America welcome every body.

"That is untrue. Google search relisha her name relisha rudd turms up many articles. And you can go onto FBI stats for missing persons every year. Yes certain cases seem to get a lot pf media attention. It's usually though not race. In Natalie Holloways case she vanished while on a high school trip in a foreign country. Her suspected killer walked and killed another girl later her parents were very active in her case and made numerous media outlets twll their story. In the case of Chandry Levy also a top Google serch, was killed by her scumbag boyfriend politician and he got away with it. In the case of Relisha. The last day she was seen 2-2614. She was not reported missing until 3-1_14. On 3-25_14 FBI offers 25k reward. Relisha disappeared and the people she was with ""the janitor amd his wife sold her"". Her mother sold her to the janitor. Sex trafficking is real and more kids disappear from homeless shelters, through CPS, churches and the very established to protect them than are even reported. In other countries parents sell kids to pay debts. It is similar here but not discussed. Remember some one has to report a child missing first. Children run away from Foster Care and a "" parent "" won't report them missing so they can still collect a check for them. We live in a sick world, yes independent sick people commit horrible acts. But the bigger problem and the larger numbers of kids "" missing "" are those that society never hears about. We don't want to face the fact that churches sell children. We don't want to admit that pizzagate is real. I conclude by saying that any child missing should hold the highest priority in our police force and in our community. But they are not. Who is still looking for Relisha? Even the Holloways and Levy family have had to hire PI and do their own research and yet they still have no answers, no justice.",0

Stop making it about race and make it what it is, it's only the rich ppl who get the media attention and not every white person is.",0

It's probably my favorite number, no it is my favorite number. You know what, it's probably more like the number two but with a lot of zeros behind it. A lot. If I'm being honest, I mean, if I'm being honest. I like a lot of zeros. Except for Marco Rubio, now he's a zero that I don't like. Though, I probably shouldn't say that. He's a nice guy but he's like, on and on, like that. He's like a computer! You know what I mean? He's like a computer. I don't know. I mean, you know. So, we have all these numbers and we can add them and subtract them and add them. TIMES them even. Did you know that? We can times them OR divide them, they don't tell you that, and I'll tell you, no one is better at the order of than me. You wouldn't believe it. That I can tell you.

I can understand if an individual who didn't have a happy childhood or didn't have a close and healthy with their parents, especially with their fathers can have this unsettling view of this guy. That being said, I don't think this man deserves that kind of attitude or treatment. He's performing a kindness so rare to be honest my own brain had trouble registering and I find that sad. The video even says it, these kids aren't adopted because no one wants to deal with death; to care, nurture, and love a sweet little soul knowing they're going to die is not something a lot of people want to deal with but he's doing it because someone has to care for them. They deserve a warm homemade meal, kisses when they're sad, to laugh and to be tucked in nicely in a soft and warm bed. Even if they're going to live for one more month, and I find it more upsetting that people condemn him instead of realizing how many foster kids have probably died without knowing that love. It's bad enough healthy foster kids have a low probability of adoption, these sick kids have an even lower chance. I get it, people have glimpsed evil but I like to believe people are innocent until proven guilty. Personally I don't believe he is a sick man to want to hurt these kids; you don't want attention on you when you want to hurt someone, you want to remain hidden and anonymous and he's fostered 40 kids and buried 10, that leaves 30 children and probably a handful would say something if he did abuse them.",0

To be fair..most countries have immigration policies. What would Canada do if millions of Americans crossed the border everyday to live in Canada? The only difference is Canada's corporations & politicians didn't offer under the table jobs to millions of people. Now that immigration laws are actually being enforced..it's going to cause pain to people who have lived here & raised families here for decades. This should be taken into consideration. Is there some racism involved.. yes. Not only are the people genetically not European 'enough' but the culture differs. So..a lot of whites won't say it..but it bothers them that a different culture will make up even more of a substantial percentage of American population. Regardless of this every country has immigration policies. America needs to take some responsibility & try to handle this as fairly as possible.,0

The main focus now needs to be on reforming our immigration system so that it is easier for hardworking people to come to the US.

The only way to end illegal immigration is to fix the system and create a more feasible process for legal immigration.",0

"That is untrue. Google search relisha her name relisha rudd turms up many articles. And you can go onto FBI stats for missing persons every year. Yes certain cases seem to get a lot pf media attention. It's usually though not race. In Natalie Holloways case she vanished while on a high school trip in a foreign country. Her suspected killer walked and killed another girl later her parents were very active in her case and made numerous media outlets twll their story. In the case of Chandry Levy also a top Google serch, was killed by her scumbag boyfriend politician and he got away with it. In the case of Relisha. The last day she was seen 2-2614. She was not reported missing until 3-1_14. On 3-25_14 FBI offers 25k reward. Relisha disappeared and the people she was with ""the janitor amd his wife sold her"". Her mother sold her to the janitor. Sex trafficking is real and more kids disappear from homeless shelters, through CPS, churches and the very established to protect them than are even reported. In other countries parents sell kids to pay debts. It is similar here but not discussed. Remember some one has to report a child missing first. Children run away from Foster Care and a "" parent "" won't report them missing so they can still collect a check for them. We live in a sick world, yes independent sick people commit horrible acts. But the bigger problem and the larger numbers of kids "" missing "" are those that society never hears about. We don't want to face the fact that churches sell children. We don't want to admit that pizzagate is real. I conclude by saying that any child missing should hold the highest priority in our police force and in our community. But they are not. Who is still looking for Relisha? Even the Holloways and Levy family have had to hire PI and do their own research and yet they still have no answers, no justice.",0

Its terrible. Its just terrible. Look, if you want to know what 2+2 is, do you want to know what 2+2 is? I'll tell you. First of all the number 2, by the way I love the number 2. It's probably my favorite number, no it is my favorite number. You know what, it's probably more like the number two but with a lot of zeros behind it. A lot.

I'm Shannon Buckner cosin' I live in aiea and I never knew that I had any shares. I don't think my grandma knew. How does someone owns land when we never paid for property tax ever.,0
"WOW, just fueling the fire aren't you!!!! Let not forget to be decent people that are working together in a peaceful way to be what we would like to see others be. To be what our ancestors would be proud of us being. Choose your battles wisely. Standing rock is a great example of this. Many people's coming together to challenge the darkness.",0

"I love how they're saying it's crazy difficult to live in Mexico. After living there for 2 years i know for a fact it's not. A cell phone is around 50 pesos which is like $3 in American dollars. Then is around 300 pesos which is around $25. I met a white guy who didn't know any Spanish make enough money to pay for his house, food, and his 2 dogs just by washing cars every day. I love my Mexican friends here in the states and I'm Mexico but let's not make there situation something that it's not. Mexico has a very crappy government but if you really wanted to become something great, there's nothing holding you back.",0

"Braden Paynter I watched the actual footage from this event and they cut this video off without showing the Prime Minister's response or Trump's answer to the reporter's question. He was making a joke, albeit ill timed, but this is a great example of media bias.",0
"This touches my soul so deeply and I feel so much joy, mixed with so much hurt, mixed with a fair amount if guilt. Joy that these children find the love of family they so deserve. Yet it hurts so bad to be reminded that these are kids and they're dying so young. And I must admit my shame and guilt that I so wish I had the strength to do the same but I do not think my heart could take it. Thanks so much for people like this who remind me that we haven't lost our humanity.",0
"Well done,u r fit to win a medal in the Rio Olympic,r best wishes.",0
"Very nice ad. I would love some love for the atheists too. We get such a bad reputation also,but I have many muslim and Christian friends who are very close to me.

"The design of the Pipe Line has proven to be detective from the begining. We have witness it by their leaks, fires and explotions that it is not a safe way to transport the oil. North Dakota has had over 250 leaks not reported by the state nor the media.",0
"How much love can a man have and want to share... A heart so big it wants to share it with the kids that needs it the most.

Its more like money to me. Many of the times the girl or boy that goes missing have wealthy parents so they can move quick. We the not wealthy ones just pray that we find our loved ones with the help of oir Sad bit true,0
Olympic Games aren't worth the money they cost a country. Large scale facilities are ghost towns after the games. Not sure they do much more for tourism either. Money can be better spent,0
"Scary speech. That speech makes America sound weak. When we are already strong and great. We need need to lead by example. Be humble and deligent, even though some may push us, we must not falter and give in because we are patient and thorough, we must be the world leader that we always been. And not act like we want to be a world leader. We must step forward open handedly not 2 steps back. This speech is scary because it's targeting specific groups and benefiting no one. We all suffer one way or another. I hope that our new pilot does not fly us into the deep part of the ocean. Let's see what's",0

"Obama also spoke of protecting the Constitution in his inauguration speech, and we all know how that turned out. The so-called most transparent administration in history prosecuted the most whistleblowers in history, and oversaw the expansion of a digital surveillance state into every aspect of our lives. All these words mean absolutely nothing. I judge the man by his actions.",0
Wow! This is spirituality in action. I wish the world's organized religions with their trillions worth of wealth and property would learn from these people and feed the hungry of the world...not just in LA where the condition of the hungry folks stands out in stark contrast to the ostensible material wealth around. ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è,0

Such a wonderful man.. I know kids can be tough at times when they wake you up at night. And this guy is doing it single handedly for so many children with special needs and that too are not his own. Can't think of any other deed that is better than this man's work. God bless him and these kids.,0
The Indian government should be ashamed of themselves to killing innocent people in Kashmir!!!!!!,0
