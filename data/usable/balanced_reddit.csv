I, uhm, can't quite see what you're getting at, Jack. Ripper: Water, that's what I'm getting at, water. Mandrake, water is the source of all life. Seven-tenths of this Earth's surface is water.

Ripper: Have you ever heard of a thing called fluoridation. Fluoridation of water? Mandrake: Uh? Yes, I-I have heard of that, Jack, yes. Yes. Ripper: Well, do you know what it is? Mandrake: No, no I don't know what it is, no. Ripper: Do you realize that fluoridation is the most monstrously conceived and dangerous Communist plot we have ever had to do you realize that in addition to fluoridating water, why, there are studies underway to fluoridate salt, flour, fruit juices, soup, sugar, milk, ice cream? Ice cream, Mandrake? Children's ice cream!...You know when fluoridation first 1946, Mandrake. How does that coincide with your post-war Commie conspiracy, huh? It's incredibly obvious, isn't it? A foreign substance is introduced into our precious bodily fluids without the knowledge of the individual. Certainly without any choice. That's the way a hard-core Commie works.I first became aware of it, Mandrake, during the physical act of love...Yes, a profound sense of fatigue, a feeling of emptiness followed. Luckily I-I was able to interpret these feelings correctly. Loss of essence. I can assure you it has not recurred, Mandrake. Women, er, women sense my power, and they seek the life essence. I do not avoid women, Mandrake. But I do deny them my essence.",0

">You might as well argue that the Supreme Court upheld slavery at one point, which it did, so why argue against slavery? And I *would* if we still had slavery and it had never been overturned and I was talking to somebody who was trying to tell everybody the courts were I might provide my own *moral* reasons to be against yeah, a discussion of the law would require me to bring it up if the person was pretending the Supreme Court was against slavery when they had actually upheld it. >Rights are not based on morals. They're granted by the virtue of funny, you *say* that as if those two things conflict somehow. ""It's not morality! It's just a series of rules about behavior based on a human's intrinsic worth!!"" What exactly is the reason to separate the two things, other than the word 'morality' obviously makes you mad, and reminds you of religion, which makes you *really really* mad?>It's a right derived from the need of the individual, If it was derived from the need of the individual than progressives would be right in saying we have a basic human right to food and shelter and all that stuff, and the Gov't would be obligated to provide it. Rights aren't based on something as pragmatic as human needs, they are based on human worth and dignity. If you're any sort of libertarian or then you believe primarily in *negative rights*; i.e., rules about what *other people aren't allowed to do to you*, i.e, morals. >Obscenity is the very definition of a group punishment upon the individual, the offense of others as a reason to inflict tyranny on the minority.No more or less than any law that comes down to a group vote. If you're going to cry 'tyranny' in every instance the minority doesn't get their way, you may as well rename judges as regents and give them the authority to rule over every aspect of our lives. In the mean time, *Of fucking course* communities get to decide things like 'can you sell dildos in a school zone' based on the community's wishes (measured by voting), and of course histrionic language about tyranny doesn't actually change that. >Honestly, make me sick that's clear. You should probably calm the fuck down and compose some better arguments if you're going to address one in the future. >Anyone that would lock up another human being for scribbles on paper should never speak of standing for anything resembling human dignity.Like for example this ridiculous fucking strawman. Here's another one: those degenerate libertarians make me sick sometimes. They want every community on earth to look like a goddamned Bangkok red-light district, because apparently not being able to walk down the street of your home town without seeing people jerking off in public and screaming at you is what freedom is supposed to feel like.",0

"Don't go, we need all the good people we can get to keep working on this shit.Let's face it, where SJW's rule, cancer is the imposed order. I've honestly come to appreciate a very few subs here on reddit, as being places where the mods actually get the basic concept of freedom, that they don't need to nanny the of a bunch of free adults as if we were toddlers about to put scissors into each other's eyes. I was pointed at r\metacanada a long time ago by a friend, who thought it was merely a shit-posting bullshit Canadian version of the donald, but I quickly found it's one of the few places left you can actually have a free and honest discussion. The Jordan Peterson subs are another great crowd, with enough great folks to far outweigh the inevitable idiots, and the mods are very genuinely tolerant there too.I would actually go so far as to say that reddit has been the very most worthwhile forum site I've participated in so far over decades of internet time. It's not perfect, and many subs are either not as free as they should be or even ruined, but there is still huge opportunity here to have extremely good discussions with people, and the overall format is capable of supporting in depth content in a way that sites like facespam and twatter can't begin to touch. So I say take control, and only make good things of real substance here, reap the rewards of what is worthwhile, and leave behind the trivial and the BS. Fuck r\canacuck, you don't need to deal with idiots and assholes who can't handle even the most factual reality. The free and sane places will be rambunctious and irreverent, sometimes in the extreme, but that's good, it's alive for real, instead of by the thought :)",0

">The premises in the presentation are that censorship by the platform owner is acceptable provided the rules and effects are clear, is politically neutral, and focused on tone, Some moderation exists on every virtual platform that I'm aware of. The point that Insights is making is that you have to identify what your moderation is going to be and effectively communicate it without taking a political bias as a platform. That's entirely reasonable. >They see the platform owners as ""hospitality organizers"". That's just a quote giving context to their primary point, which is: ""People are asking how to behave on your platform, rather than solely how not to"". This means that they are saying that users want to understand what is *supposed* to be their standard of conduct, rather than just what *isn't* their standard of conduct.>For one, I don't see any more a ""hospitality organizer"" than I see my email provider: they provide a service by which I may communicate with others. The standards I use to communicate with friends are vastly different than those I use for business contacts, and I neither expect nor desire those standards to be enforced by the email provider.These are wildly different things in both a digital and legal sense. Your emails are *private* You literally have (under American law) an expectation of privacy which *even the police* are not allowed to violate without proper judicial and legal grounds. Public comments on a public platform to engage in a public conversation are going to be totally different and have completely different moderation. I'm not even convinced it would be *legal* for Goggle to moderate your these providers already see themselves as politically neutral and focused on tone, so following those guidelines just gives us more of the same. And of course tone itself isn't politically neutral: see the censoring of the legal term ""illegal aliens"" (though to their credit they appear to have backed off on that decision).The report specifically tells them to be politically neutral as part of being more consistent with their rules because tech companies *haven't been*. Google's failure to learn isn't a problem with the being transparent about why you'e censoring someone doesn't really help the person being censored that much. We know exactly why The Daily Stormer was deplatformed: the GoDaddy CEO woke up one day and said ""I hate these guys and want them off my site"". Transparency helps when the rules are consistent. That's the point. You have to do both, that's why both are recommended. What happened with GoDaddy is an inconsistency of the application of rules, not a lack of transparency. If GoDaddy were to be consistent and transparent, they should have a rule that states: ""GoDaddy reserves the right to remove your domain, without notice, at any time, because the CEO doesn't like what if I don't want these platforms to ""police tone""? Tone policing exists in a social context, whether you like it or not. It's why you can't just run up to someone and start screaming ""FAGGOT!!!!"" in their face, and why American law would probably allow them to hit you to get away from them. *Some* boundary exists for tone. The point that Insights is making is that you should be policing tone *and not content*. SCOTUS does the same thing with the first amendment. It's why the government is not allowed to engage in ""viewpoint but is allowed to arrest you for disorderly conduct if you won't stop if there is a problem with ""tone"", why enforce a top-down, one size fits all approach to it?They actually say that users will have shifting desires and demands, and a one-size-all approach doesn't fit.Is fifthly a word?...>When Germany censors things it's to ""make online spaces safer"", but when ""dictatorial leaders"" want to do so it's to ""improve their methods of control"". One is the justification of the German government (which you see everywhere in lots of governments), and the other is just a quote from Soros.>And on the page where they discuss flagging porn (which has regulations around providing access to children) and malware (which has quantifiable harmful effects) they provide a case study of The Daily Stormer (who was engaged in legal if unpopular speech) being taken off the internet, thereby trying to create a (strained) association between the three.The page is about ""active curation"".

For me the first result is Total POS admits to being a if I search for pedophile POS it should work, right? we know a known result is not coming back with proper search terms. Edit 3: it seems ANY COMBINATION of [word] + pedophile has no results. Not sure why that happens but it is NOT related to biden, except that biden is a [word] + pedophile. Using one of the most common words in english, ""The"" we can see this results in the same no results: think this at least dismisses the idea that google is directly modifying search results for a specific and focused purpose in this. Frankly this is much more confusing than that would be, I really do wonder why it is setup as such, It seems a bad method to avoid politically searches as such, when you can just do: the second result for me is ""joe biden is a pedophile"" with numerous more results trailing down. I think this puts the idea they're using this specific case mentioned by the poster above for this purpose. They may modify results or other nefarious and biased things, but this particular case, it isn't happening. Please when you make claims, look deeper. Otherwise we become just like those media asshats we don't like, the ones who jump to conclusions and scream RACIST, SEXIST, or POLITICAL FALSE NARRATIVE! Let's not be them.

Also, calling those women's rights activists ""feminists"" and their adversaries is not always accurate, as feminism is an explicit ideological position with a rich theoretical foundation (whatever any individual may personally think of that foundation) and not simply any effort to make things less shitty for women. So I suspect that's what they are getting at, but I also do think it's important to not allow feminists in the west to claim the glory by proxy of serious political actors in other parts of the world by simply hanging their label on them unchallenged when it may not be accurate.",0

"> From a purely utilitarian standpoint it isn't hard to fabricate (or even find in history) examples where it's very likely that the minor gains in happiness of the many outweigh the horrendous suffering of the few.Yeah but what do we get out of systemic racism... That's not a positive, not even a neutral for the That's just a negative for everybody. (Barring the few who actively get pleasure out of inferiority of others.) I feel like I'm defending something really obvious here.> And to come back to reality, the question of stopping racism isn't as simple as flipping a boolean of thinking racism is good/bad, most people you find arguing against current measures supposedly against racism (or its impacts). like affirmative action. will not argue that racism is a good thing, but that those measures don't actually stop racism (or its but if you scroll up to the person I responded to, they said that to even be against racism makes you an SJW, who people here clearly hate. So if you want to instead argue about potential solutions and affirmative action, sure, but can we first of all agree that taking an adversarial position against racism (for now ignoring solutions) is desirable for a society, or at the very least that people who do aren't despicable or irrational beings?",0
"> If you support the movement that is currently holding sway among the ""populist"" right wing - eg Trump fans, the ""alt right""/ ""alt lite"", popular online commentators eg Milo, Cernovich, Coulter, the Proud Boy movement - then you are inevitably throwing your hat in with the ""religious right"". It's those people and their supporters that have brought about the state of affairs we have today. And you may call yourself a liberal, or a libertarian, or even a ""non-political person who just wants to play games"" - but by standing in the way of liberalism and progressivism you are enabling those people, and ultimately taking their side in the debate.Divide and conquer tactics. Not only that but you're completely inaccurate. The alt-lite, and even the alt-right, habitually go out of their way to transgress and shock the sensibilities of the religious right. Milo has openly rejected the religious right and is himself flamboyantly gay and married to a man, he's spoken about how he was a fan of Marilyn Manson back during the previous culture war, etc. Much of the alt-right is pro-abortion, some of it (including Richard Spencer himself) is accepting of gay people, and the entire alt-right worldview is incompatible with Conservative Christianity as it exists in the USA (the alt-right being rather anti-semitic whilst conservative Christians are to mention, *conservative Christianity is in both political and demographic decline*. Younger evangelicals, by the way, are less anti-gay than their elders, so the ""conservative Christians"" are being less conservative every day. Your package-dealing of ""liberalism and progressivism"" is outright wrong on every level.>Is it really ""classist"" to disagree with someone because you don't think they are educated enough to understand what they're talking about? Its classist to immediately dismiss them as racist because they don't use sufficiently eloquent terminology. You should at least try exercising interpretive charity. >The basic fundamentals of the issue are not complex, you don't need a college degree in sociology or theology to understand the principles. Tommy isn't conventionally educated but he isn't stupid, he knows what he is doing. Hence my phrase ""weasel words"".Would you consider Douglas Murray racist then? Or bigoted? What about Bruce Bawer? Because I don't see them making substantially different arguments, they just use more educated language to do so. >I don't believe it is unfathomable bigotry. As a liberal progressive, I am quite happy to say that I think a lot of the principles of fundamentalist Islam are utterly abhorrent, and incompatible with modern, liberal society and values. I know for a fact all of my liberal progressive friends would say the same thing.Then why do Sam Harris and Richard Dawkins... both on the left... get accused of bigotry for saying *precisely that*? What about Bill Maher?You *know* this happens.>What left take issue with, is right wing political views which imply that ALL Muslims agree with those horrible and totalitarian ideals, and in particular with those that try to say that this ""fact"" means that Muslims shouldn't be in western / non-Islamic countries.Apart from Pamela Geller and perhaps Milo, I don't know anyone who says this. Douglas Murray doesn't. Tommy Robinson doesn't. Harris and Dawkins don't. Christopher Hitchens never did. Maajid Nawaz doesn't (indeed, he's a Muslim). Ayaan Hirsi Ali doesn't (and she specifically repudiates such positions in her book *Heretic*). Almost all of these figures have been accused of ""racism"" and ""islamophobia"" however, by certain people on the left.>But you just need to go and look at comments on, say, Breitbart articlesYes, comments on Breitbart articles are a fucking dumpster fire. But its exceptionally unlikely that *comments on Breitbart articles* will become the guiding lights of policy within the West. You know those people are exceptionally fringe.>the viewpoint that they should be entirely barred from the west (or indeed wiped from the face of the Earth altogether) is fairly established and unchallenged amongst the ""right"".As someone who's been a libertarian for decades, has spoken with people from the left and the right, the idea that there should be a *blanket ban on all Islamic immigration into the west* is *anything but* accepted orthodoxy on the right. At most, I see arguments for civic values tests, enhanced screenings for links to terrorism, and in some cases temporary quantity caps or temporary pauses. And are you *fucking kidding me* about the idea that ""wiping Muslims off the face of the earth"" is somehow accepted orthodoxy on the right?!? *Libertarians, and Trumpists are all less interventionist than so that's even *less* likely to happen. One or two ranters on *Breitbart* says nothing about actual policy platforms. >I am open minded enough to be able to see that there are elements of totalitarianist thought on the left - due to the fact that at the end of the day, society needs laws, to some extent, in order to function, and laws inevitably boil down to rights being restricted and freedoms being impinged.That's not an open-minded viewpoint at all. Its a phony attempt at balance and you know it. The proper role of law is to *ensure* rights by prohibiting the *violation* of them. There is no ""right to murder"" and thus laws against murder do not violate anyone's rights. Yes, society needs laws, but that's a vacuous truth. You're ignoring the absurdly long history of totalitarianism on the left; every form of Marx-inspired ideology degenerated into 20s/30s/40s progressivism, an ideology of the left, was essentially fascism with pretentions. Auguste Comte was hardly a right-winger and his philosophy has been absurdly influential on the technocratic left; Comte was a devout totalitarian. >However in my opinion the extent of the left's totalitarianism extends to limiting people's absolute freedom of speech, when that speech has the potential to incite hate or harm against others. ""Incite"" has a very particular meaning in law. It requires the advocacy of imminent lawless conduct. The left's proposed limitations on freedom of speech are much, much broader and include even books like Charles Murray's *The Bell Curve* (which is controversial but hardly inciteful). >The extent of totalitarianism proposed by the right - no abortions, no Again, there are libertarians (mostly pro-abortion, universally accepting of private sexual conduct), many of the parties are pro-choice (for example Pauline Hanson's One Nation party in Australia... Hanson supports abortion on request), and the gay marriage issue is basically settled. The upcoming generation of Evangelical Christians are not only less numerous than the last, but also more accepting on gay marriage.>from comments on right wing outlets like BB its undeniable that many have these viewsAnd these people aren't making the policy. Hell, they're more extreme than Breitbart's own entire screed is nothing more than an attempt to deny the fact that the culture war has radically changed. You're still pretending that there are radical dominionists in the wings, when the reality is that the contemporary right has become substantially more secular and in some ways much more socially liberal than it used to be. As even Angela Nagle... an old leftist and author of *Kill All Normies* pointed out... the Alt-Right (and she was talking about the *actual* Alt-Right, not people like Sargon of Akkad) is a right wing completely devoid of Christian morality.Trying to wave 90s-era culture war flags makes no sense in today's world.",0

I won‚Äôt sit here and pretend I speak for any group of people I only speak for myself but that fact you are offended on behalf of a group of people tells me a lot about you.I'd say soapbox achieved based on how many hilarious it got me into, but ayy good for you! Maybe you should take the show's message about positivity and acceptance to heart and start trolling the misinformed incels here with facts that hurt their feelings! Like you realize some of the other people who've responded to my comment or DM'd me have generalized and insulted you personally, right?And I'm not offended, it would be wayyyy to exhausting to have feelings about every little shitty thing racists and homophobes do. I'm here to trigger libs, and judging by the carpet bombing my inbox received, I did.>All that aside no one is forcing you to be here and I think few will care about your opinion so come enjoy some memes or don‚Äôt but do have a good day.You too bud, but yeah no a good chunk of this thread is now people upset by my opinion so good try.

You can program a sex robot to scream out in pain/terror, cry ""No no no, please top"", try to fight back, etc. With a sex robot, you could simulate the rape act perfectly, to the point that if you were to film that act then it would be from filming a real rape. Just like if the sex robot were a child then ""inanimate object"" or not, filming it would be as illegal under existing child porn laws.This is all worlds away from sticking a inanimate object in your pussy.

"You know what you are saying fits perfectly with that parody I don't know why most of the world doesn't' seem to *get it*.Back in the day- maybe. Then again you used to need a fuckton of training to be able to fight well enough to defend yourself outside of a fluke. Even then what lots of people don't seem to understand is that if a government doesn't allow you to defend even legally at all with improved on the stop weapons) with weapons then they don't give a shit whether you live or die- which makes them a shit abusive can get wanting to have a sweet spot for that, but it's pretty clear most governments just think they are a better breed of human than those they rule over. That is why I think it's so fucking retarded when the dipshits say ""Common sense gun control"". For one the ""control"" is a giant rippling red flag, for two in the us you already fucking have things that are frankly according to the that lots of people find fairly tolerable even those who own and use lots of weapons. It's funny how they seem to think their aren't background checks when the only way you can not have them is limited as fuck sales between people- which you can't really control anyway as it's nigh impossible to track.If you do any half decent amount of business with guns you *have* to get a FFL. Even a pawn shop that may have like 10 guns top at any given time would have to have a fucking FFL.I'm sick of either complete ignorant dumbasses that don't even try to do any real search- even the basis trying to act like they know what is good for everyone else, or worse yet deliberate fucking liars- that still probably don't know shit but they know just enough to know they are wrong and you think about it, control is the big word. Especially why they not only want to legal for extreme cases but act like abortion is a *virtue*. They don't want us filthy plebs breeding too much, unless we are their slaves. I mean that was the point of abortion with cunts like Sanger. Kill all the darkies so they can't rise up against the whites- or as of now, and maybe as of always the *right kind of whites*- not saying jews I'm just saying the ""elite about marxism is about class warfare. How to get all the plebs fighting against each other so the elites are safe. Just when the soviet's started it the crooked power hungry ones weren't the elites yet, so they had to fix that. After that they had to make it so only *they* could say who gets to be in the elite class.The more things change, the more only the names change and the elitist power hungry crooks are always the same kind of people- besides in random could say I'm paranoid- but am I *really*? Are we really all that different now as the human speices save for techonolgy than when we had fredual lords, and only the right kind of people who served the guys at the tippy top got to be in the peerage? If someone basically was so awesome even though they weren't in the elite to begin with they had to be let in it pissed the elites off so much, because it shows that if anyone is good enough they need to be let in, or they can always just break down the door and take it for themselves, and that pisses them off.Anyone here read or watch Berserk?

It is a type of circular reasoning and an informal fallacy: an argument that requires that the desired conclusion be true. This often occurs in an indirect way such that the fallacy's presence is hidden, or at least not easily apparent.The phrase begging the question originated in the 16th century as a mistranslation of the Latin petitio principii, which actually translates to ""assuming the initial point"".***^[ [^PM]( ^| [^Exclude ^me]( ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit]( ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information]( ^| [^Source]( ^]^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28",0

If the granting of pussy passes to women wasn't so prevalent and noticed than subs like this wouldn't even exist because a story about a woman going to jail for a crime just wouldn't be are countless subs however just absolutely dedicated to blaming men for everything and anything. Feminism, offmychest, and pretty much any default or formerly default sub will readily showcase this anti-men sentiment and overall hate that men have to face constantly. We get blamed for everything, are considered to be the perpetrator when we are the actual victim), are looked at as criminals without actually having done anything wrong, get screwed over by the court system constantly, and otherwise have everything going against us while we get to sit here listening to people talk about all of our ""privilege"" and so is it at all surprising that a sub that allows men to vent about the constant situation that is our society is wanted and needed? Is it somehow wrong to allow men to talk about what they see in society or to complain about it? Why is it that when men do complain suddenly it's something that needs to be dealt with or destroyed? Is having somewhere to allow people to expose their frustrations really all that bad of a thing?",0

Dude you fundamentally fail to understand that social issues are so much more intrinsic to identity which has everything to do with what right/left divisions even are. Almost nobody has any principled attachment to economic ideology. The conservatives were close enough with the nazis on their social policy for them to align.You're ignorant as shit for believing that economic ideology is as much of a motivational factor as identity. Like I'm in California and it's vast majority left wing. We just voted on a proposition that forces EMT workers at private companies to be constantly on call and have to work through breaks. These bleeding heart retards just fucked over one of the lowest paid people in the medical field because they think it's saving lives. All this is proof of that every fucking ideological basis can easily be manipulated into betraying their economic beliefs if they think it will promote their social utopian belief structure.I don't need to educate your ass into understanding that fascism is inherently right wing regardless of whether or not it has elements of radical economic policy derived from the left.Fuck off.

I guess you will shoot this down by saying ""Ha! but this change also benefits women! They are allowed to have careers, independent incomes etc"". Which is totally missing the point. This is what is meant by the idea that feminism is about fostering true equality (note: NOT between the sexes. It isn't about making ""real world changes"" designed to specifically lift one sex while holding the other back*. It's about getting away from the idea that it should be an us/them situation in the first place, and getting rid of behaviours that hold BOTH sexes back. *Unless by ""holding back"" you mean movements such as ""#metoo"" are persecuting or limiting men's freedoms by asking them not to sexually harass or abuse women, or passing laws like the ones that criminalised rape within marriage were persecuting men for not letting them rape their wives any more.

Most of your questions are answered in there and there's not much point to me re-hashing it to you. You're mostly asking me about facts that could easily be found in a newspaper. The former Yale classmate was in [this WSJ article that I also linked above]( but here's [the full text of his statement]( Four years ago, Kavanaugh himself [reminisced about binge drinking in college]( and his [high school yearbook was full of references to alcohol]( and the attitude and behind the ""Renate Alumni"" thing is horrific. And let's get real, [Brett Kavanaugh was definitely the inspiration for ""Bart in Mark Judge's book.>Ok, share.I'm not sure what you're asking me.>I don't have to.I don't understand what you're trying to say here. Again, it's hard to get a bearing on what you're saying because you're really not making any points. What makes you believe that Ford would have stepped forwards when she was 16 if the story is true? You seem to agree that we know not all women do who later seem to have valid claims, so not having stepped forward does not necessarily mean the story is made up.It's within the scope of the FBI's powers to give a report to the Senate, because that was the background check. You are telling me to cite (not ""site"" btw) a source that the FBI has the authority to produce a background check that was requested of it for the Senate.>She was fine for his entire career before he was dude. Do you not know what a civic duty is? It's an obligation not to yourself, but to your country, a burden of good citizenship like voting or serving on a jury. The transcripts are online, but the relevant sentence of Ford's testimony is, ""I thought it was my civic duty to relay the information I had about Mr. Kavanaugh‚Äôs conduct so that those considering his potential nomination would know about the assault."" You could have consulted a dictionary or listened to Ford's happened to both of them.Again, the civic duty thing changed the balance. I think (hope) that we agree that these kinds of allegations should not be made lightly and should not be taken lightly. The consequences of both airing out a false allegation and of suppressing a real one are severe. It's inherently a balancing act, so, yes, both of their lives are now set before the court of public opinion. Kavanaugh, however, is a public figure, so he put himself out there by nature of his occupation choices, but that's a minor point. I think the bigger point is just that *this is the nature of our adversarial system of law.* The point I was trying to make about the embarrassment and publicness of these allegations, and prosecutions is not that they shouldn't happen (although we should be cautious, and they've kind of gotten out of hand recently), but that they are an deterrent. I'm not making an argument for whether or not it should change. That's a whole other conversation. I'm making the argument that in light of this, it is why a real victim might not step forwards *until the added conviction that it is her civic duty* tipped the balance in favor of stepping forwards even so many years missing the point about the supplemental FBI It was excessively limited in scope and a weak defense for the argument that Kavanaugh never did any of the things alleged. Avenati's trashy (he was Stormy Daniels' attorney, for reference), but that was a opinion and no excuse for the FBI not even interviewing him or his client.

"> The link you posted does not reinforce this point, it merely says more people intermarry, but that is easily correlated with a rise in other ethnicities and the trend of whites to become a national minority.How does the rise in other ethnicities explain away the increasing trend of intermarriage as evidence of immigrants' children mingling? We're looking at the effects of increased diversity, so the increase in other ethnicities is a given. The question is whether they stay clustered or mingle.Are you really trying to say that Whites aren't participating in these > The most common racial or ethnic pairing among newlywed intermarried couples is one Hispanic and one white spouse (42%). Next most common are one white and one Asian spouse (15%) and one white and one multiracial spouse (12%).Looks like we're all mingling! Or, is that what really bothers you? > Depends on the immigrants, not all immigrants are weighed equally. This is the part people like you always forget. For example, Jamaican and Haitian immigrants commit way more crime than Dutch and German immigrants. Literally zero people on the Right are claiming all immigrants are the same, but it is statistically more likely for Mexican immigrants to commit crime than Japanese people. Those are numbers you cannot debate, which is likely why you strawman the conservative position.If you think that ethnicity itself drives criminal behaviour, then you're being blatantly racist. Crime rates are driven by inequality, and inequality often breaks along ethnic lines. That's the only reason there is any correlation between crime rates and ethnicity. this widespread confusion fuels policies which see Canadian police forces funded, not based on actual crime rates, but based on the threats posed by minorities. point isn't to judge individuals based on what groups they belong to. It's to build the kinds of communities that produce less crime. Spoiler: those are diverse democracies with lower inequality and socialist policies. > Diversity for the sake of diversity is not a strength. That is retarded. There is absolutely no data to back that up. If you believe so, you will have to explain to us how blacks, jews, and indians have different brains than whites. You'll have to explain how on a genetic level they are different, as well as cultural. To argue for diversity being a strength, you are in fact arguing for racism.Not sure why I would have to explain anything about various brains, especially since I already cited evidence showing that more diverse communities with more immigrants have less crime. Maybe take a few breathes and revisit that PBS link.I'm not saying ""diversity at all costs,"" any more than you're saying ""all immigration is bad."" But generally increased diversity IS good. There is evidence for that. You're just refusing to look at it.",0

"Where in the video did the police try to cuff her? Is it before they pushed her? Or after the cop punched her in the face four times? Cause I didn‚Äôt see it. Who else in the crowd was trying to hurt the police? Who, exactly, and speak loudly so the court room can hear you, was being aggressive towards the police other than the woman? If they were there for crowd control, why, at the beginning of the video, were they all crowded into one corner? Thats bad crowd control tactics if you ask me. If this stuff rarely happens in Holland, why is the cop so afraid that this lady posses a massive, lethal threat? Punching people 4 times in the face, throwing them on the ground, kicking them while they are down is standard Dude, what the fuck are you talking about? What the hell kind of country are you from? Punching someone multiple times, throwing them on the ground, kicking them, waving a baton around THEN arresting is THE most efficient way to handle her? Instead of, ya know, just tackling her and cuffing her? The lady is absolutely in the wrong!!! I am not debating that! I am debating the cops use of excessive force‚Äî of the lady doing what she did. Cops are supposed to be better than the people they are arresting‚Äî according to you they don‚Äôt have to be because ‚Äúit rarely happens here.‚Äù What happens when it DOES happen there? Do you all just shrug your shoulders and proclaim ‚Äúwell the police are ALWAYS right?‚Äù I get it, you love the police more than your mother, but it still doesn‚Äôt make it right. You say the police will ‚Äúnever‚Äù use excessive force on you or a loved one... what happens if they do? Seriously, what do you do then? What if you or a loved one ends up dead because of it? You just shrug your shoulders cause the police are always right, right? Basically, all you have told me is that you are pro-police brutality ‚Äúbecause it rarely happens here‚Äù and you are completely fine with ONE man being a judge, jury, and You are also fine with stripping away the human right to a fair and equal trial.

"In that event, the only reason that it's found out to be false is through admission after guilt eats away at a person. If that person were going to be punished, would their fear of that punishment allow them to come forward and elevate that not. So the innocent person in prison will continue to rot away in prison, and their innocent will never be known at all. To whatever degree it even allows.It's not a pretty situation. There's never going to be one. Just as rape victims have to accept that sometimes real rapists will get away with it because of lack of evidence. Rape is the ugliest crime to deal with in the legal system for a reason. It's a mess, and will always be a no solution to the mess. We can only do the lesser of the evils when we decide what that is. I was going to say that in a perfect world people would come forward and face the punishment for their crimes, but that's retarded. They wouldn't commit the crime at all in a perfect world. So we can't even get into that situation. People aren't going to willingly come forward and face punishment. We live in a world where people rape, and people lie about rape. We can't ignore that just because you want to punish everybody who does the bad things. Yeah, that would be nice if we could just punish bad people. But we can't, because if there were a punishment.

"I play GTAO and recently just argued this with a friend. If you have a desire to just buy shark cards, then you don't actually have a desire to play the game. Over the past few months, simply logging into the game has netted me millions of GTA bucks. They have double cash promos all the time and they have giveaways all the time that simply hand you money.Now, if you wanted to invest time into the game and actually play it then you should have enough money by the end of doing everything to buy almost everything in the game. All the DLC is end game content. It's like buying an expansion pack with virtual currency. And once you have the CEO expansion with a garage (probably $2mil you can do car heists to make money. This alone makes buying shark cards for someone who doesn't have time anymore super easy. In 15 min, you can quickly make and more if you collect a set of cars.Shark cards are for two people: people who want to play that don't have time but want a fancy car to run with their friends OR people who think because a new car is out, they must buy it like some autistic gamer.All the things you buy in the game for the necessity to have fun are cheap. If you need the fancy stuff, play the game as intended or spend you money.Back in subject though: Cheating should never get you any time in jail.

"> TL;DR: Stick to 2D, and you won't have any legal issues. In the absolute worst case you'll be hit with an obscenity charge, but even if you are, you can contact the Comic Book Legal Defense Fund and they will defend you for free.This isn't a very sane analysis of those cases. Nothing you've posted doesn't prove it's not illegal. It [clearly is]( and [has survived scrutiny]( under several cases. It's just that, similar to piracy and myriad [other stupid laws]( you are very unlikely to be prosecuted unless you are already being targeted. The same way you aren't going to get a ticket for not wearing a seat belt unless you are caught doing something else too.However, **and this is the important part**, companies and very public entities don't have the luxury of fading into obscurity the way citizens do, and they already have leverage on them in the form of business licences. If they're big enough they might be able to bribe themselves out of it but they can't exactly afford a public media blitz that they distribute child pornography. That's why you are going to see this stuff being banned on platforms and censored by translation companies, because even if it's likely that the private citizen isn't going to get nabbed for this sort of thing that's not a risk anyone is willing to take with their company and investor's money.*Also you are sorely the ruling in the [Christopher Hadley Case]( What happened in that case was the court re-affirmed that Hadley could be charged under the PROTECT Act of 2003 as long as the material was deemed obscene. That's why he plea bargained after that determination, because he knew full well his material would be deemed obscene and he'd be convicted anyway. Here's a quote from the case that makes it very clear. It's not a separate obscenity charge. It's another provision under the same law which has the same penalty, and you still get put on the sex offender registry as well.>**This conclusion has minimal impact on this case given the almost complete redundancy of the conduct criminalized by subsections 1466A(a)(1) and (b)(1) with that of subsections 1466A(a)(2) and (b)(2). The observable differences between these subsections are (1) subsections 1466A(a)(1) and (b)(1) incorporate the Miller test as essential elements, whereas subsections 1466A(a)(2) and (b)(2) do not; (2) subsections 1466A(a)(2) and (b)(2) include the ‚Äúappears to be‚Äù language in relation to ‚Äúa minor;‚Äù and (3) subsections 1466A(a)(1) and (b)(1) encompass a broader list of sexually explicit conduct.**>... >>The indictment in this case simply charges Defendant with violations of subsections 1466A(a) and (b). There is no reference to whether Defendant is being charged under subsections 1466A(a)(1) or (a)(2), or (b)(1) or (b)(2). The conduct outlined in count one states sufficient facts to allege a violation of ¬ß 1466A(a)(1), and the conduct outlined in counts two through four state sufficient facts to allege violations of ¬ß 1466A(b)(1). Because subsections 1466A(a)(1) and (b)(1) incorporate the three-prong Miller test for obscenity, these portions of the statute are not overbroad in violation of the Due Process Clause. The conduct alleged in the superseding indictment delineates violations of those constitutional portions of the statute; therefore, Defendant‚Äôs argument that the entire superseding indictment must be dismissed based on overbreadth must fail. It also follows in line with the [Whorley case's]( finding.>But in making his argument, Whorley ignores the language of ¬ß 1466A(a)(1), which prohibits visual depictions of minors only when they are obscene. See 18 U.S.C. ¬ß Ashcroft itself noted that obscenity in any form is not protected by the First Amendment. See Ashcroft, 535 U.S. at 245- 46; see also Miller, 413 U.S. at 24; Kaplan, 413 U.S. at 119. Thus, regardless of whether ¬ß 1466A(a)(1) requires an actual minor, it is nonetheless a valid restriction on obscene speech under Miller, not a restriction on non-obscene pornography of the type permitted by Ferber. **We thus find Whorley‚Äôs as applied constitutional challenge to ¬ß 1466A(a)(1) to be without merit**.",0

This has ZERO to do with elitism, snobbery or whatever, those are the facts.

And a long procession of women were saying how their loving partner or brother tended to become a selfish, arrogant, insensitive, uncaring asshole while on T. They would refuse to believe their partner's distress was worth stopping the T for. So long as they didn't hit her they could not see the problem. T and empathy don't seem to correlate within a group but they strongly correlate in an individual. It is common for men to become more empathetic as they age, I guess because of falling T. It also is commonly noted in fathers, our T drops during pregnancy and stays down a while after birth.

It‚Äôs more widespread and apparent then a random lunatic posting here and there.I‚Äôve been called a racist hillbilly nazi by a plethora of people on reddit simply for my username (which is just jest ) and the fact that I hold somewhat ‚Äúconservative ‚Äú political views.You see it on twitter etc all the time. Candace Owens being bashed and having racist insults thrown her way by WHITE antifa members for being a conservative. Kayne being labeled as ‚Äú not black ‚Äú because he ‚Äúsupports ‚Äú trump ... those are just two quick examples.How often do you see CNN/MSNBC condemning ANTIFA ? (a self admitted stateside terrorist Group) Have you been to r/politics ? Literally just try and post something semi positive about trump or republicans in general ... or try to ‚Äúdefend‚Äù some ignorant meme that is put up and instead of a debate you‚Äôre immediately labeled as a racist ‚Äúalt righter ‚ÄúPosts are not even allowed if it‚Äôs in any way negative to liberals/ Obama/ Hilary etc. If you make a comment pointing out faults with the liberal establishment etc you‚Äôre also called a racist nazi etc ... it‚Äôs quite troublesome and honestly just downright ignorant It‚Äôs especially comical considering everyone just automatically assumes my .The Alt-left has just gone completely bonkers.That being said I truly do hope more liberals are similar to you than the loud vocal Alt-Left groups we do often hear/witness.,0
">Now who's using shitty ad hominems. There is a difference between using ad hominems, and having your entire counter argument be ad is fucking stupid.

I've never said that im just saying male privilege is a thing. Which you refuse to admitNever said that, and everyone has privilege, some more than others. The conversation you jumped in on was about men somehow oppressing women with their privilege because women have expectations of other why the hell would anyone condense an argument?>I mean I'm not gonna lie I came to this sub which personally I think is pretty sexist at times to argue.You came here to argue with the sexists, you accused me of being sexist, you can't back up your argument, and my arguments are too long for you.Jesus, if you're going to pick a fight at least try to make sure you are capable of holding your own before hand.It's fine though, I love people that hop into random subreddits with the intent of judging everyone that posts in them. Especially when the very next thing they do is accuse the people they pick a fight with of being should check out our sister subreddit, r/pussypass While it has nothing to do with this post, some of us browse these subreddits because we are tired of watching criminals get away with a slap on the wrist because they have vaginas.You know, those subreddits where ~~we~~ sexist men discuss this thing called ""privilege"" that ~~we~~ sexist men don't understand.",0

Even if they bring up 10 witnesses, I'm not going to trust someone's memory over something that supposedly happened 36 years ago.That said, I think he's unsuitable because of how he composed himself when faced with this controversy. A supreme court judge should be someone who can remain level headed and calm, even in the most difficult situations. He let his emotions get the upper hand of him, broke down over really weird things (really, crying over a calendar?), deflected questions back at the people asking them instead of answering, ...In short, he didn't act like someone I'd like sitting on a supreme court bench for the rest of his life (not that I have a dog in this fight ,as I'm not desperately cling to this guy, who's shown he isn't mentally suited to act professional under extreme pressure, while there is a list of other possible judges for the position?

Use the officer training that you were supposed to have received and de-escalate the situation by cuffing her‚Äî not beating her to a pulp. But whatever. Fine. If a cop ever uses excessive force on you or a loved you, you have no right to get mad about it because, according to you and the dutch, they can NEVER be wrong‚Äî if they are wrong, the other person is even MORE wrong, therefore, apparently, the cop is right.

Try to explain to me how 6 cops can‚Äôt apprehend one drunk woman. If they can‚Äôt they need better training. Let me ask you: whats the point of the judicial system, according to you? Honestly?

"You can actually murder the cop if he is illegally arresting you. You'll need loads of proof that you were innocent of the crime that he was arresting you for, but yeah, unlawful arrest is hella illegal and there are a lot of legal precedents where people legally killed cops that were illegally arresting them.A lot of people have a deep-seeded love affair with cops though, so they'll tell you that you *have to* comply with any order that a cop ever makes of you. Those people are wrong. You can not only fight off a cop that is illegally arresting you, you can murder a cop that is illegally arresting someone else too. That is what the US Supreme Court has ruled. your specific example about being confused with a burglar, however, it would probably be ruled these days that the cops had ""reasonable suspicion"" to arrest you; which is basically a catch-all for any and all behavior that a cop wants to do. So the real question is: how much of the law will a cop/judge bend in order to protect themselves in the event of an unlawful arrest? The answer is: a lot. A lot of the law will be bent and even broken in order to protect a cop that commits an unlawful arrest, so you therefore would likely not be able to exercise your *right* to defend yourself from cops. Kinda scary.There are a plenty of cases though, even recently, where people are found innocent of murdering an unlawful cop... but most of those people still spent time in jail, and were even badly beaten by other police (see the Ray Rosas case), so you'll probably still miss your flight... but there was a guy that killed a cop in self defense then evaded other cops for 6 days and was still found not guilty, so who knows, you might be able to catch that flight after all.It's a very imperfect system, and anyone that you find defending it is usually ignorant of it and has a Just-World Fallacy and thinks that all cops are good guys and they only ever catch bad guys... or they are a cop themselves, and they benefit greatly from this fascist shit show.",0

If a stupid girl started ""harassing"" a grown ass man by calling him names , ANY NAMES, and she would not stop, and she was in NO WAY apologetic or indicative of stopping, THEN she should not be surprised AT ALL when she gets her ass WOOPED. Why? BECAUSE YOU SHOULDN'T HARASS PEOPLE! Sometimes the ""payment"" for harassing another person is a FOOT IN YOUR of verb1 a : exhaust, fatigue I have been harassed with the toil of verse ‚ÄîWilliam Wordsworth b (1) : to annoy persistently was harassing his younger brother(2) : to create an unpleasant or hostile situation for especially by uninvited and unwelcome verbal or physical conduct was being harassed by her classmates claims that the police were unfairly harassing himTHOUGHT N@#$ and HONKEY are ""just words"" They are ""uninvited and unwelcome words (deemed so by their targets)"" Which to answer 2:That's a SUCKERS QUESTION, and I'M NOT A SUCKER.See, I am black, BUT I AM NOT""the Black Ambassador of explaining to white people why black people do stupid shit.""I DON'T KNOW WHY THEY DO THIS SHIT, I JUST GREW UP AROUND IT.I DON'T WORK for the NCAA.I am not Paid by the society of gainful Negroes, or whatever.AND I WORK FOR MONEY.So since I HAVE NEVER received my ""defending or explaining black people"" check in the mail, They SHALL NOT BE DEFENDED OR my fee is ludicrously you'll gets no answer from me, cause It ain'ts my job to explain a race of people actions to you.Now if you paid attention, ALL of MY COMMENTS FOCUS ON of how its done.NOW THE REASON A WORD IS SO IMPORTANT IS THIS.It is CLEAR in BOTH the above example AND YOUR EXAMPLE. That people are harassing others. What did they use to Harass their they ""KNEW"" would hurt them or rile them up. THAT'S WHY THE WORD IS IMPORTANT IN THIS CONTEXT.Both girls in both examples could have said ""rutabaga casserole"" with the same intensity and it probably WOULD HAVE WENT NOWHERE.We as a species, use WORDS for their meaning and SINCE THE INTENT FROM BOTH GIRLS WAS TO HARASS their targets.They chose the Right ""Words"" to Achieve their goal - a Harried Target.N@#$ for blacks with the white girlHonkeys for white with the black girl.We communicate with words, like I am to you now.But communication HINGES on us BOTH HAVING THE SAME DEFINITION OF THE WORDS, or there is or no communication at all.So, when Either girl in Either scenario CHOSE to HARASS another person, they went for the best weapons in their arsenal, THE WORDS THAT EVERYBODY UNDERSTANDS THEIR MEANING TO BE""You piece of shit, I am above you/or you are worthless by virtue of something out of your control - YOUR COLOR ALONE. and I will ALWAYS be better than you because of your INFERIOR Make.""Now If that ISN'T harassment, I don't know what is.Both girls could have just said ""cherry lemonade"" and people would have just been confused and some people might hand not got punched.So words. Words are important.NOW I GET what you are saying. WHY fight over a word?And I'll say this.It's not the WORD, its the INTENTION BEHIND THE WORDS that makes it harassment, a threat, or not.And in the real world. UNCHECKED HARASSMENT BECOMES A THREAT.A Bully who calls you names and picks on your every day, soon LEVELS UP to ACTUALLY KICKING YOUR ASS AND ROBING YOU.If you let them.People from poorer neighborhoods (like me) know all to well to NOT LET HARASSMENT GO UNCHECKED, or it could cost you YOUR LIFE one day , down the road.And getting to your point.Also, I have learned THAT YOU CANT GO FIGHTING EVERY TIME SOMEBODY CALLS YOU A BAD WORD OR HARASSES YOU.It's the secret to Growing Old. ;)But you have to be the judge for yourself in each situation.And I say again. Do not be surprised if when you harass somebody, you get your ass you're just being a mean evil dickhead piece of shit.Words or not, it's still the Harassment. The Girls ""CHOSE"" the words BECAUSE THEY WOULD HURT. So again, were back to mic drop>Hold on, I've got to get to amazon, expect no more mic drops for 2 days.",0

What is done now, no matter if he is right or wrong, could be construed as slander and/or you, I am not standing here to speak for Alinity or her ex-partner. I do not know enough details about their situation, but neither does the OP. Furthermore, he is using the wrong channels to report any suspected crime. The only correct manner to address these suspicions are through the end there's only two pieces of proof, one of which is Alinity speaking in a manner that is dubious on the intent in the first place. Especially without the surrounding content of that the clip is easily pulled out of context. The other piece of ""proof"" used by these people consists of a series of tweets from her ex-husband that it was him who pulled the plug. We have no further proof other than these two things and that by itself isn't enough to warrant a public post and petition to get someone removed from a country.In fact, the more I think about it, the more it feels as if OP was denied something by Alinity and now tries to enact vengeance on her through shoddy defamation. OP needs to be VERY careful before he himself becomes liable for legal action.",0

"Just make college free, and end the bs?",0
"I surely believe it's more needed there, but that doesnt mean that there arent quirks left that needs fine tuning in the west. Take the wage gap for instance. First of all, the whole 77% of what a man makes is across jobs, not for the same jobs, so it doesnt necessarily prove that women are treated unfairly. But it does highlight some values that still linger that that limits peoples choices through norms if not by rules. You could perhaps say that reducing the wage gap is a mens issue. Cause why do we have such a gap? We put a lot of on women, but being able to earn a lot is not what we expect, so they might feel more free to pursue their passions even if it doesnt provide as much revenue, and take a workload that suits them better. Men on the other hand are considered more imporant, and are seen as more attractive, if they have money and power. So men put passions and personal well-being aside because we have to make money. Another thing that is important to remember is that we cant expect things to stay the way they are, even here in the west. Right wingers dont want women to have access to abortions or for kids to get sexual makes the girls end up pregnant) and thinks marital rape is okay. And the alt right movement has been growing a lot the last few years and is still growing. Racists and bigots are always at work, and financial interests in politics will always need a social struggle that they can use to trojan in their own politics, so the extremists on both sides will always get funding. They're pitting them up against each other, trying to create polarized enemies, and in my oppinion you're falling for that tactic. This is a threath to the basic rights we take for granted, some of which we've had for decades already and are by no means considered progressive anymore.",0

The larger and stronger he is, the more he is going to be presumed to be at fault. If he defends himself in any way, like even just block her flailing, the police are very likely to believe him to be the aggressor even in cases where his bruises are obviously defensive. And god forbid the drunk woman trips herself up during - good luck proving it wasn't him that pushed her down.b) if they manage to extricate themselves and leave, there is a good chance that the physical altercation will still get police involved and their investigation is going to start with the woman's story as primary source and by the time they get to him will be just as biased.>You aren't taking the historical context into they are..

"> Laws against speech do not change minds, Are you saying that speech laws don't have any influence in what people see and hear? Or are you saying the information people get has no influence over their views? Either is absurd. Just as important as outright bans on particular viewpoints are control over the mass media, the academia and education system. Censorship works, propaganda works and mandatory viewpoints work. They do actually. How do you think Europe was Christianized? It was by decree. Peganism and blasphemy was criminalised, and if you were expelled from the Church you lost the protection of the law. >they only enhance resentment and increase driving subversive movements underground. Those are symptoms of repression working not being futile. Movements have a much harder time recruiting when they're underground. And maybe at some point the movement you've suppressed will be completely dead. >Speech must be free in all public and common areas, the government cannot be allowed to restrict speech. Only on private property can speech be restricted and there the only acceptable method of enforcement is to eject the violator from the property.It's pretty retarded to accept tyranny under the guise of private property. Social media is the most important forum of public discourse today and completely controlled by private actors. At least the government has a constitution to follow.",0

Except in some rare case, these events are not a poor little young Billy cowering in the corner as predator Patty is shoving her tits in his face. In the case of a male teacher and underage student though, I could see it being more forced, because males are horny fucks and girls don't want anything to do with dirty old guy dick. Most of this is common sense shit we just know, but online it's like blasphemy. Anyway, this obviously isn't an argument that will ever be settled. Where I do think we can probably end up agreeing though, is this: regardless of whether you think the women was really a predator, or if it was some idiot woman and a horny kid student, ultimately she did cross a legal line and she should face As much as we might see the story for what it really is - a pathetic women who wants attention and a young kid getting some ass - it wouldn't make sense to just let it go and say ""I Obviously you can't have teachers fucking their students, you'd have to fire them immediately regardless of the And there should probably be legal punishment as well.So I think we need to take away our emotional attachment and hangups about these situations and treat it more objectively like a speeding ticket.

"> It is the 41st Millennium. For more than a hundred centuries The Emperor has sat immobile on the Golden Throne of Earth. He is the Master of Mankind by the will of the gods, and master of a million worlds by the might of his inexhaustible armies. He is a rotting carcass writhing invisibly with power from the Dark Age of Technology. He is the Carrion Lord of the Imperium for whom a thousand souls are sacrificed every day, so that he may never truly die.> Yet even in his deathless state, the Emperor continues his eternal vigilance. Mighty battlefleets cross the miasma of the Warp, the only route between distant stars, their way lit by the Astronomican, the psychic manifestation of the Emperor's will. Vast armies give battle in his name on uncounted worlds. Greatest amongst his soldiers are the Adeptus Astartes, the Space Marines, Their comrades in arms are legion: the Imperial Guard and countless planetary defence forces, the ever vigilant Inquisition and the tech-priests of the Adeptus Mechanicus to name only a few. But for all their multitudes, they are barely enough to hold off the ever-present threat from aliens, heretics, mutants - and worse.> To be a man in such times is to be one amongst untold billions. It is to live in the cruelest and most bloody regime imaginable. These are the tales of those times.

There is no peace amongst the stars, only an eternity of carnage and slaughter, and the laughter of thirsting gods. That's more than just gritty, because everything is so messed up on a galactic scale.

There's plenty of normies who have such a fundamental of our online culture that I can imagine people not understanding how these nicknames are tied more closely to a person's identity than a pseudonym or ""sockpuppet"" would account for. But, since I haven't read the underlying citations, I don't know. I am deeply suspicious about that definition, especially how frequently the author says they tweet.

"> Just reading all the stupidity going on over there and now being able to point out how retarded they were was pissing me offPretty much exactly the we're going to face. I guarantee I disagree with most of the people in this sub about so many things, but I also disagree with everyone everywhere about a fuckload of things. I like to consider both sides of every balance, but the illogical reality is that every Yin/Yang argument has the majority of people yelling either White or Black, meanwhile, they're ignorant to the fact that the heart of their own argument is the opposite color. When people see women as victims constantly deserving support, they're literally falling prey to our evolved desires to support and protect women, and while that's natural and fair, it's normally tied to a lot of freedom from the male side of the equation. As it stands now, men are being demonized, financially damaged, culturally ostracized, and hated for being weak. Men are naturally expected to be strong, but society is basically no longer allowing us to do that in many natural ways. We're still demanded to be the assertive pursuers of dating, then the hypergamous reality of women still has them dating up, all while we're being shamed for being ""incels"" like that's somehow new. It should be blatantly considered promotion of ""toxic masculinity"" to *call* people incels, yet it's what's happening culturally. And if you're strong and assertive, you better do it all perfectly in the right way and toward the right person, because otherwise you're going to be seen as a violent predator and demonized for thinking about the thing that caused every fucking one of us to exist. It's absolute insanity. I'm looking at these internet attitudes mainly, but these hiveminds *will* dictate the future of our culture. We're being trained by shills and plenty of other seamy groups into a state of purely hateful division, and it's disgusting to see this from my perspective as a humanist. All that matters to me is the chance to share a balanced perspective between different arguments, but what's happening?

Here's my reply to rest of your garbage.You don't have to explicitly say something for me to follow your reasoning to it's logical conclusion. If you truly think the man was in the wrong for hitting back then you either don't view women as equals to men or think women should be afforded extra privileges alongside the equal rights they already have. This would make you a sexist or a supremacist, pick your poison.I don't like double standards for one reason. It creates inequality. I don't want women to be let off the hook for ASSAULT just because ""muh wamen"" as much as I don't want men let off the hook for ASSAULT because ""muh men."" The moment you start allowing double standards to be normalized is the moment you take your first step towards an unequal, tiered justice system. Women wanted equality and this is what it looks like. If you or anyone else has a problem with it then maybe you all should admit women meant just the benefits of equality with none of the recognized your type of asinine and stopped you before you could waste my time with arguments that this sub has debunked thousands of times before.

"KIA history lesson for you kiddos:Rule 3 has been around ever since KIA was flooded with retarded off-topic threads, which was met with a counter flood if meta threads bitching about all the off-topic spam to the mods. I was there. I remember. Apparently the rest of you have memories of goldfish or some shit.Some loosely worded ""no off topic"" prohibitions were introduced at that time, alongside the self-post rule for good measure. The problem was this didn't satisfy either side; people kept bitching about the off topic shit and other people started bitching their shit was removed.The point system was introduced to clarify what exactly was considered on topic or off topic. Reportedly, there had been transparency issues; some threads were removed for one reason, others stayed up despite clearly violating the same rule. It ultimately depended on how the individual mod interpreted the rules. People complained. Fair enough. So a point system was introduced; people were given exactly what the rules were going to be and told point blank that the mods would be enforcing them to the letter. Or more KIA discussed and proposed the new rules and then voted on them in a series of meta threads. With transparent rules, everyone would be on the same page when they submitted their thread. And mods would not be applying any personal judgment when enforcing them; they would remove things that violated the rules because that's what the community decided and they wanted to forestall the mods had people literally vote on a new point system, because the mods *actually* enforced the existing point system blindly and to the letter, which was exactly what they had promised. And as it turned out, the point system wasn't flexible enough to cover all edge cases, which meant a lot of seemingly on-topic shit was removed and some arguably off-topic shit passed. Cue conspiritard nonsense about nazi mods. Mods don't enforce rules Nazi mods. Mods do enforce rules leading to unfortunate unintended results? Nazi mods. This was *despite* the fact that the point system was literally hashed out and voted on by verified KIA members.So people voted on a more relaxed point system including a return to the self post rule. And that's where we are today: a nice, comfortable middleground after years of pendulum swinging back and forward in response to listening to those bitching about nazi mods and spam.So no, rule 3 doesn't exist for mods to be cunts. Rule 3 exists because the mods stopped listening to divisive, polarizing, D&C, faggotry. **And good riddance for that.** Dozens of popped out of the woodwork before, during, after the last round of voting and the mods literally stopped paying attention to them. Feeding trolls only makes them hungrier and noisier. The more attention they gave these people, the more they fucking whined and bitched and accused them of being Nazis.",0

In fact, I'd say that there's something intrinsically hopeful about the series (and the titles) purely from the basic gameplay: players overcoming trials and hardships, vanquishing mighty foes encountered along the way. As for the story, I'd point to the End of Fire ending of DS3, which I'd call the best closure to the series as a whole, being built on the Fire Keeper's hope that mercy-killing the world altogether will eventually give birth to a wholly new one. It's just foolish to call Dark Souls hopeful by pointing to the Age of Dark, its nature being one of the series' most contentious story is a little more pessimistic in that none of the endings put a stop to the turmoil caused by warring Great Ones and their aspiring human servants, but at least the Yharnam Sunrise ending has you personally escaping from it.> So to sum it up.

"I'm going to devils advocate against Crowder for a second:I think that if you allowed for a rather generous definition of ""Rape Culture"", a rape culture _actually does exist_ on college campuses. Hear me out. At least, up until the recent Title IX insanity, here's what's going to happen. Say you have been raped, assaulted, or otherwise have a credible accusation. You go to the school (your first mistake!) over this. What do they do?Obviously, rape is really really bad and the school wants to prevent it, stop it, and bring consequences on the predator. But... there's other factors.Maybe it turns out that the accused is from a very politically family, and if you pursue action against hi, his parents make trouble for you. Maybe his cousin is a major donor to the school, or he is a star student in sports or academics and has a really great reputation that the school gets to enjoy by proxy. Or maybe, maybe the school just wants to keep their risk of reputation damage to a minimum.It doesn't really matter the specifics. The fact remains that _*the university's priority is to protect the university, not the students*_. The university is working with HR bureaucracy incentives: make the problem go away as cheaply and quickly as possible so we can get back to business as usual. Often times, and _especially_ in more ambiguous situations (everything from regret-sex to situations), the easiest way to do that is to take the bare minimum token action so the victim feels like you did something, and then sweep it under the rug. No investigation that makes rumours spread, no spooky increase in rape stats for your campus, no potentially making powerful people mad. Just Make It Go Away. If you're someone who is actually a victim, and you actually want justice, and you go to the and this happens, you could be forgiven for believing that this is of a ""rape culture"". From your perspective it sure looks like _rape happened and they didn't care_. But in reality it's just a natural consequence of the fact that bureaucracies follow incentives and the university has some very strong incentives hanging over it, much stronger than one hysterical freshman.But I would argue that it is absurd to call this a 'rape culture'. Even if the situation I've laid out means that it is literally true that there is a culture that covers up rape, it is still incorrect to call that a rape culture. Why? Because 'rape culture' has a connotation that this is about rape specifically, and that it's at least partially intentional. In fact, the situation is actually caused by a higher level, more general thing, for which the rape scenario is just one of many consequences. If anything, it's an ""incentive culture"" or a culture"".Of course, the fundamental cause of this whole scenario is a mistake on the part of the victim: Why the _*fuck*_ would you go to _university over a _crime_. The university is NOT fair and NOT neutral. They are in fact heavily biased in favour of ""whatever costs them less time, money, and effort"". They're NOT your friends. The university solves problems for _the university_ and sometimes the problem (to them) is the victim who won't drop the issue. All of this, ALL OF IT, is trivially solved if people do what they're supposed to do and _*report crimes to the police*_. For an analogy, imagine an HR department at work. Imagine you have a problem with someone at work. Doesn't matter what it is. Do you report them to HR? What if the problem is that this other asshole is constantly muttering insults under his breath towards you. Oh, also, this asshole has been here for 15 years and saved the company from bankruptcy. And you started 3 weeks ago. If you go to the HR department they're immediately going to think ""oh, seriously? The veteran employee _saved our company_ and this dipshit who hasn't even been here for three years can't take a joke about it? We have to get the newbie to shut up before the veteran gets pissed and quits to take that job at Google we know he's been eyeing"". They want _the situation_ to go away but that is not the same as solving your problem.The absolute best case scenario for you going to HR is that HR brings in the senior guy and tells him to knock it off. And now he's mad. He knows that you narc'd him out to HR for the things he said and now he's pissed. Out of spite he'll give you terrible performance reviews and you'll never get promoted. He'll make even snarkier comments but always in a way that's plausibly deniable. By going to HR over this, the only thing you did was make your problem worse.You could look at this situation and say ""SEE, THIS COMPANY HAS A HARASSMENT CULTURE"" but that's not true. Actually, this company has one guy who is kind of an asshole, that everybody kind of hates, but also the company realizes that there's some unpleasant realities about the world that can't be escaped. If you're the victim in this situation, you could spent your whole life getting bitter over it and complain about how corporate america has a harassment culture. You could see your career stagnate as you spent too much time complaining and not enough time doing your job. You could turn into a pathetic shell of a human being. Or you could man up, take some simple and commonsense actions to stop the petty jokes (eg maybe avoid him in the hallway), and if the behaviour is sufficiently severe, go to the police over it. TL;DR: Retarded 21-year-old children don't understand that bureaucracies will always work for their own best interest and label this ""rape culture""",0

As theories of race moved from theological tobiological, the rationale for racial hierarchy relied even moreheavily on the ‚ÄúNegro-ape metaphor,‚Äù as Lott (1999) described it.Although this linkage predates scientific racism, it drew increasedinterest and popularity when Franz Boas, the preeminent anthro-pologist of his time, and even Charles Darwin, speculated thatthere might be an evolutionary spectrum among primates (Lott,1999) containing monkeys and apes at the least evolved end,continuing through savage and/or deformed anthropoids, and cul-minating with Whites at the other end (as most evolved; Jahoda,1999).

However, only 2/3 of sexual assaults are reported. In reality, this number is much lower-- making a false rape allegation extremely rare. ""Even strong advocates for rape victims admit that false accusations sometimes occur. The real debate is regarding the frequency of these false claims. Some suggest that only 2% of rape accusations are false (a rate that is similar to that of non-sex offenses), while others state that the rate is higher (e.g., 8%).There are several possible reasons for this wide range of estimates. For one, it appears that some analyses conflate unfounded and false. Legally speaking, the term unfounded describes claims shown deemed not verifiable or report may be considered unfounded if:If there is a lack of physical evidence or there are a large number of between existing evidence and the victim‚Äôs claim.Thus, the terms unfounded and false are not the same.

Clearly, nobody is thinking with their heart or soul, but it is useful for conveying complex situations or emotions. The widespread denial of ""gender"" on this sub is kind of ridiculous and a good 40-60 years behind scientific research. It's like being side-by-side with a bunch of when protesting the launch of an orbital deathcannon. We happen to be on the same side for this issue, but it's embarrassing to be seen in public with those nutters (and yes, they are very vocal about how I'm a dirty SJW for believing in the made-up concept of gender, and how they're embarrassed to be sharing this space with me).I used to describe GG as being made up of two categories of people: People defending video games, and people attacking SJWs. By now that's kind of a dated analogy, but it might also be useful for the way I see things. The main focus of my post was only tangential to OP's. I'm saying that for me, being here is not really as much of an ideological bubble as it is for some of you, and my presence is probably doing the same for you.

There's still the matter of what you do with your fear. In this case, concluding little more than ""[My critics] should learn why"" externalizes the overreach, it doesn't own it. ""I'm afraid even when I don't need to be sometimes"", or ""I'm afraid but I try not to let it affect my would be sentiments, and would, I expect, garner respect and sympathy. Fear is a beast, but there are still responsible and irresponsible pet owners. As far as the mockery goes, it's definitely a stance worthy of criticism. While I can sympathize with fear, and understand that we can't control what brings visceral terror into our hearts (save for not wallowing in horror stories and frightening ourselves), a person still has to employ their higher faculties to manage the bad actions or prejudiced, faulty thinking that fear might move them to, be that an outright veto or at least recognition and mitigation.

Anyone with a vitamin deficiency in the Western World needs to be checked for various GI absorption or metabolic issues.

"I agree completely, especially about how hard it is to be a non-leftist transperson and how many people don't understand autism (30%+ you HAVE heard the definition of ""nonbinary"" from a non-SJW. It's just everything that isn't male or female (which means that it is INCREDIBLY broad. That's why it doesn't make sense to say there aren't nonbinary people).You're right that society is totally geared to label people into M and F. But that's changing because people are are naturally biased to reduce any topic down to a binary. But as we know that doesn't reflect reality; it is simply a shortcoming of the way we process information (and normally it isn't a shortcoming and it helps us solve a lot of our problems).IMO 20 years ago a **huge** portion of society didn't *believe* in trans identities. They looked at a person and said: ""that's a dude in a dress"" or ""I bet that bulldyke is a (or whatever they said. I wasn't old enough to notice so I'll just be as offensive and basic as I can imagine lol). But now trans identities are commonly recognized and generally understood (especially since the time when GG started). I foresee that a similar level of understanding will organically (aka slowly) spread over the next 20 years about people who don't feel comfortable identifying as male or female.I might be completely off-base.

Hell Scotland (where I'm from) is a hugely left wing country but PC culture is also largely ridiculous to most of us. Our favourite comedian is Frankie Boyle (a major left winger), a man who, when given a TV show, decided to make it the most offensive thing ever just to push the limits of PC culture.We don't hear some middle class retard bang on about how we need to ALWAYS be PC and think ""Oh that sounds right"" we collectively say ""oh fuck off and grow up"" which is why a LOT of left wingers were pissed off when that guy got charged for making his dog do a Nazi salute but that was an English, law he was charged under.We view offence to words as being the most ridiculous thing ever, probably because we're the butt of a LOT of country's jokes so if we were to get outraged at words we'd be permanently outraged and we're pretty much born angry so we'd be apoplectic at thing is though, right wing sources won't show you that. They'll show you some other dickhead with the minority opinion that PC is absolute, and they'll frame it as ""the left are against free speech"" which is patently ridiculous.I have this conversation a lot with people where they say ""I'm becoming a lot more right wing because..."" and then they go on to list the same things as you, the voice of a retard with a minority opinion who grew up in middle class where everyone was super nice to each other and afraid to say the wrong thing lest they insult the easily insulted dickhead at the end of the street.You need to take a break from right wing sources and go speak to actual left wing people, research policy and understand that, just like when the media tells the left that Nazis are everywhere, right wing media is telling you that your worst fears are also everywhere, when they're to think for yourself, and soon you'll see that by a factor of about 90%, left wingers and right wingers are no different in mentality. We're only separated by media influence that aims to keep us divided so the powerful elite (the rich) can do whatever the fuck they want to us and we'll be so busy fighting each other that we'll let them do let them do it, because the left is the only ones standing up to the elites while the right continue to support absolute corporate freedom that hurts us all.",0

The ONLY people I have had issues with are women who are bitchy, put each other down, get jealous over nothing and act like entitled princess babies instead of grown women. Pardon my French but you are a massive cunt and I'd be willing to bet the reason you hate men is because you feel NEGLECTED by them because you have zero redeeming features to make a man want to give you the time of day.

In the years past I have been hailed as a champion - for 7 straight years I have spent November as a chastitised christian. I hoped to continue this legacy. And last night, I failed.One as regal as I, failing? Impossible. Only the gods could achieve such power to stop me. I guess that night I was dealing with a god.I'm on the YouTube homepage, trying to find some epic Morgz videos, when I stumble upon a certain video. This damn video. Its bright thumbnail, its captivating title - it utterly fascinated me. This cursed video: it was none other than ‚ÄúFortnite's most EPIC event EVER!‚Äù, posted by the one and only Ali A.My body immediately began to shake, and my penis shot straight up. The most EPIC event EVER? What could it be? I felt a pull towards the video like I had never felt before. It took me awhile to realize the effect the video was having on me. I fell back in my chair in fear. In agony. In complete and utter despair.My hand grabbed the mouse and began to slowly slide over to the thumbnail. I kicked and screamed and cried, trying and failing to stop my body. Sweat was dripping down my entire body. Minutes later, the pointer had finally reached its And with a cry, the hand that didn't feel like mine anymore clicked.I was immediately met with a scream. ‚ÄúTHIS IS IT LADIES AND GENTLEMEN!‚Äù Purple light streamed from the computer monitor and began to fill the room. The voice on the screen continued talking, seemingly in an ancient tongue. My entire body began to quiver as something awakened inside of me. My speakers began to shake as something inside of them grew louder. Was this music? Or was this something else?The music finally picked up, and as Ali's intro began, I came harder and faster than I ever had before. The sensation rendered me The last thing I remember seeing that night was my cum streaked over his face. And it looked like he was smiling.I woke up to a rising sun. My clothes were back on, my sweat was wiped away, and my penis was flaccid. I could finally see again. Was this all a dream? No, there‚Äôs no way. It felt too real.My suspicions were immediately crushed as I looked to the monitor. In a drunk stupor, it looks like I had changed my desktop background to a picture of him. He was staring into my heart - into my soul. And he was covered in my cum.So, guys, whatever you do, don‚Äôt watch Ali A's newest video. Anybody less powerful than I would surely be dead.

"The article feels like the author wanted to write a story about their friend's game and write a call for greater inclusion, but couldn't write a full article about either, so they just combined both.From the first few advisors] completely ignored my game-making aspirations and just pushed me more in the TV/film direction. As a self-conscious teenager, if the game-making excitement had been nurtured a bit earlier I think I would have started making games sooner. You need some kind of aspirational figure, or someone who's excited about the prospect of it - or at least, that's what I needed and I didn't have it. It was only recently when I became a bit jaded about working in TV and film that I realised games was what I really in my gut wanted to do.""Are there aspirational male developers for guys to look up to? Do all male game devs go into the industry looking up to and trying to become living meme Todd Howard? Reading through this it seems like this person is needlessly gendering the first issue they bring up, in reality I don't think that there are any significant paragon developer figures we can all look up to. More than that, if you're citing a group of career advisors who likely have no experience with gaming but watch TV and movies like it's a religion, no wonder they aren't advising that you go into games. It may even be coming from a place of love, they see TV and movie people making millions, but couldn't even name a development studio, let alone specific dev.Then, of course, the gamedrop:>""A lot of the challenges come from the online space. When things like Gamergate bleed into the mainstream consciousness, it's not going to do much to reinform the public or aspiring developers about what the industry is like,"" she says. ""And that's a shame because I really have met so many creative and progressive individuals and organisations from my short time in the games industry.""Her direct quote is interesting, a generous interpretation may hold that she regrets what the media made of GG, because she's met supportive and nice people on the inside. Her later quotes argue for greater but do so in a relatively sane way, so it could be.The article goes into her game a bit. It is evidently ten minutes long, but is a to the games Ico and Inside, the film Paths of Glory, and the German TV show Generation of War? How do you manage that many in a ten minute game?Some literal unconscious character is central to a concept Fernandez was interested in: creating an emotional attachment between the player and the 'tool' used to solve puzzles (in this case, a human body).She shows some remarkable sanity regarding how she thinks greater representation should be achieved:>""One thing that I really want to stress is that I don't think the solution is to police or censor violent or sexual depictions of women in games. To me, it's about creating a bigger variety of female instead of just repeatedly falling back on character tropes. It's in everyone's best interest. We'll have far more interesting games as a result.Again, a generous interpretation would be that she wants to make her own games with new female characters, our over at will appreciate that approach I think.Then some of the facts regarding the Battlefield V fiasco, and this gem:>""It's intimidating,"" she admits, ""but it's more important to me to make stories I'm interested in with characters I'm interested in, rather than fear this imaginary audience who will probably troll me online at some point in my career anyway.The author of the article is kinda bad, but the dev depicted seems to have her head/PR game on straight.",1

I have no doubt that they were CIS.What you need is a new treatment that's shown great potential in the field of child rearing. Naturally children don't like it but they have definitely learnt to get a better handle on reality. We call it ""The Smack^TM"". ""The Smack^TM"" seems to have produced far more effective results in keeping children from entertaining retarded fantasies about being colorful ponies, believing there are more than 2 genders, and just generally being barely passable as human. ""The Smack^TM"" has also shown promise in the areas of turning people away from feminism, victim studies at university and college, communism and at keeping kids focused on learning something that may actually prove useful to them in the future. While studies are ongoing, ""The Smack^TM"" is still in clinical trials and not recommended for use at this time. However, we heartily endorse its use in the home, at school, and anywhere kids from ages 3 to 20 can be found.",1
"This seems to a bit of an idiotic topic but there is some merit it in perhaps... though I have seen anime that does the opposite. I'm not talking about like pointless abuse. Honestly in a lot of anime, they abuse the concept of smacking a guy around because he is a dense fucker and can't knock before entering a annoys me a bit too but it isn't a monolith. Take Maken-Ki ecchi as fuck anime. That happens to the main dude, he literally forgets because he rooms with a few chicks. Now it's possible to forget, but in a small defense of them. If you forget 24/7 that's being fucking Secondly this guy does peep on chicks sometimes, so it's hard for him to claim innocence because sometimes he really *isn't* innocent.As much as I found inuyasha to be garbage for this, and other reasons, it made a lot more sense in Ranma 1/2. Ranma *went out of his way* to poke at his, somewhat Sure people should get over their but when someone has about not being feminine enough maybe when you have to live with them you shouldn't tell them like 8 times a day they suck at being a chick. Ranma was a dick to both Akane and other people at least half the time.Now, on the flip side you have recent shows like konosuba and Aho Girl.Kazuma right out states he's having none of this bullshit. he will also smack a bitch if he thinks she's being an idiot, not that ti works with darkness cause she's a kinky masochist and gets turned on by that, even when he acts disgusted at her behavior in public and means it. He will routinely tell aqua she is useless and a bitch in public- because she is.In Aho girl main dude is possibly a bit of a dick but he has lived around the main sex obsessed bitch for his entire life, her precocious ass would routinely do things to him in their childhood that he didn't want to do that might well border on sexual assault, he was too physically weak to stop her. This lead him into gaining more strength, probably mostly just happened because puberty. He now due to her current actions and past actions *knocks the fuck* out of this chick, who is in fact so fucking stupid she routinely gets zeros on all of her tests **all of them**. His aggressive, pretty much assault and battery, treatment of this chick scares everyone around him especially the other chicks, but he just has no more patience for this chick who is selfish, stupid as and a **MEGA THOT** obsessed with his dick.So both extremes exist and largely played for comedy. The chicks doing it to dudes is more common but let's see western media even as a joke try to do some of the dudes not putting up with chicks bullshit. It wouldn't fly- Japan doesn't seem to give a fuck maybe because they don't seem to be as psychotic over there and realize that shit ain't real.",1

Is this about black Heimdall and black Domino and the lack of outrage about them being race bent while people start forging flaming pitchforks over a black Ciri or I'd argue that as supporting characters they are given more freedom to be fluid in their race and possibly even sex.

And if their written well then they race bending is excused as open casting rather than a forced diversity hire.,1

"Gaming/Nerd Culture, +2Plus either Official Socjus or Socjus Attack By Media for the +1The article literally argues that *Lovecraft contributed nothing to horror besides themes rooted in racism, misogyny and homophobia*. This is going far beyond merely saying he had unsavory opinions. The argument is that *every single Lovecraftian trope is unavoidably tainted and carries within it Lovecraft's own Everything good about Lovecraft, the article argues, is evident in the works of previous authors.The implication is inherently censorious. Not only is Lovecraft to be removed from the canon, but *nothing that feels too Lovecraftian* (in aesthetics or tone) can be permitted.Not only that, Lovecraft is attacked for ""grossly simplifying"" ""mental illness"" but that just shows absolute stupidity about Lovecraft's depiction. Lovecraft wasn't depicting mental illness or ""actual"" insanity. Legally speaking, insanity is a complete break from reality, but in Lovecraft-land *people in mental asylums are closer to reality than the rest of us*. This is an atrocious demand. The analogue would be that, because Tolkein had some unsavory opinions that influenced his writing, the entire genre of fantasy must abolish the use of orcs, elves, dwarves, etc. They're going far beyond merely ""critically discussing"" the work of previous authors. This is a demand for a purge of the canon and even the *destruction of a particular style of writing*.",1

"Cop here: I also was suspicious of the 2%-10% claim.

More so than how they act (I‚Äôve had some [real] sexual assault victims act very quiet, or very sad, or very mad) but mainly their stories make sense.The false ones that I‚Äôve just don‚Äôt make sense and it‚Äôs blatantly obvious. The timelines don‚Äôt make sense, big plot points change, suspect description changes, or the suspect has definitive proof of the lie.I‚Äôve commented on a case of mine before where when I talked to the suspect he showed me texts from the night in question from the ‚Äúvictim‚Äù saying no one could find out about them hooking up or her boyfriend would hear.Well the boyfriend heard and when I showed her the texts (from her to ‚Äúsuspect‚Äù) she just apologized and got up to leave the room (like that was going to be the end of it). Taking her to jail was very satisfying. Cops still should have due diligence to investigate all claims like they are true. I have sisters, a mother, and a wife and if some cop blew off a real assault I‚Äôd be furious. But IF the report is proven false, that person needs to go to jail.

"These types of women have so much penis envy they'll get aggressive about anything just to prove they have a dick, but they will never- have- a- dick... or is their struggle, their suffering, their is the problem- There is a lack of feminine energy in the world. Women can feel this, but can't understand it. See, the world needs both feminine and masculine energy. Masculine energy is risk-taking, conquering, competitive. Feminine energy is nurturing, expressive, (something else). Men are suffering because we are wrongfully shamed when we express our soft emotions and creative sensitivities but we aren't bitching about it like feminists would. Ya know why? Because it's a bitch said that, feminists are attempting to bring gender equality by being more masculine. See, this is where women always fuck up. They are slaves to their emotions. When they feel something, no amount of logic will change their instead of being the beautiful, loving angels they're meant to be, embracing their strengths and interests, they would rather exhaust all their energy going full retard in a vain attempt to become second-class men in spite of their femininity. They want female empowerment so they abandon their own female nature. Brilliant. Buy a dick. Super glue it to your pussies. We'll never see another post like this again.",1

"Reading the study, a lot of the supposed identifying features of ""Russian trolls"" sound like people from 4chan.>16 of these 33 troll/sock puppet accounts appear to be Russian trolls, or at least possess several of the Russian troll presented above. 7 of the 16 had auto-generated handles consisting of a very common, English name followed by a series of seemingly random digits, and five of those seven had not uploaded a profile image, a combination which according to the studies mentioned above, is a typical characteristic of Russian troll accounts.Those usernames are the ones *Twitter itself* autogenerates if you don't bother to come up with a username when you make an account. Not mentioning this reflects either gross ignorance or example of an account that almost sums up these Russian troll carries an auto-generated handle and has almost exclusively tweeted disparagingly about The Last Jedi, and engaged in ‚Äúanti-SJW‚Äù rhetoric. In the middle of these tweets, the account all of a sudden tweeted in support of Donald Trump during the latter‚Äôs visit to the United Kingdom, which was met with large protests in London. Besides not containing any personal information, having no profile picture and other Russian troll this account only posted 9 tweets in more than a year from its creation in January 2017 to February 2018, all of them regarding a particular Anime series on YouTube. From April 2018 onwards, during the lead-up to the release of The Last Jedi for the home video market, and in anticipation of Solo: A Star Wars Story opening, the account suddenly comes to life and begins tweeting frequently about The Last Jedi, identity politics and Rian Johnson. After the data was collected, the account has been through a ‚Äúreset‚Äù where many of its public tweets have been deleted, leaving only its replies.Gee, I wonder if there's any other demographic besides paid shills for the Russian government who don't care about Twitter enough to bother making a username or uploading a profile picture, value their privacy enough to not upload personal information and to periodically purge tweets, dislike SJWs, like Donald Trump, dislike TLJ, and like anime.>One of the accounts which has now been deleted by Twitter exhibited some of the lingual that researchers have observed in Russian troll tweets. On July 11, tweeted: ‚ÄúSo, now explain why Mark Hamil didn't like Luje in TLJ?‚Äù. The simplicity and brevity of the language, as well as the fact that this purported Star Wars fan doesn‚Äôt spell ‚ÄúHamill‚Äù or ‚ÄúLuke‚Äù correctly, are all indicators that raises suspicions. In combination with other handle, lack of personal matter on account etc.), the verbiage suggests that the user may be a Russian troll.

"tl;dr is last paragraph.It looks like you're going to work on the ""east side"" which is the area. If it's a tech job, understand now that tech workplaces are pretty bad in most places when it comes to the social justice set.I lived in Seattle and outlying areas for a really longtime. The city has drastically changed for the worse. It's not yet San Francisco bad, but they're trying. city government is more corporate oriented, so you'll still see pro-business Republicans in municipal government. They tow the party line on most social issues but it isn't a of that said, Western Washington is a really diverse place. Want to live in the woods with rednecks? You can do that. Want to live in a trendy condo? No problem. Want a suburb? Plenty to choose from, and it's all commutable to the east side. For the most part, you can live in the sort of place that suits you and the amenities in the urban core are superb. State government isn't great but not nearly as bad as things you need to know about:1.) The rain is oversold but there is a marine layer over Western Washington for about 7 to 8 months out of the year. It's really, really grey.2.) The cost of living is terrible, Traffic is a nightmare along the I-5 and the I-405. Seattle is willfully shrinking traffic capacity and the east side simply can't build enough. Topography aggravates this. Avoid bridges.4.) Politics have radicalized over the past 20 years as Californians and people from the East Coast have flooded into the city for tech jobs.5.) Yet large corporations like Boeing, Starbucks, Microsoft, and especially Amazon dominate the political and economic landscape. It's really the worst of both worlds.Good things:1.) The economy is great.2.) World class food, festivals, beer.3.) Water, mountains, forests, all within an hour drive. It's an outdoors man's paradise.4.) Once you get away from Seattle most people are really chill. Sometimes too chill. 5.) Sea-Tac is a real international airport.6.) Great sports is an 8 on the California scale. The east side is a 5. Most of the rest of Western Washington is a 3 or 4. If you can afford the cost of living and are capable of biting your tongue now and then, I'd say don't hesitate to give it a go if you have a real opportunity up there.",1

"Of course we do.>In the early-to-mid 20th century, the phrase ""politically correct"" was used to describe strict adherence to a range of ideological orthodoxies. In 1934, The New York Times reported that Nazi Germany was granting reporting permits ""only to pure 'Aryans' whose opinions are politically correct.""[2]>As Marxist-Leninist movements gained political power, the phrase came to be associated with accusations of dogmatic application of doctrine, in debates between American Communists and American Socialists. This usage referred to the Communist party line which, in the eyes of the Socialists, provided ""correct"" positions on all political matters. That is the history and that is how it is implemented today. Regardless of attempts to ~~redefine~~ mask the function, that is what it is at collective orthodoxy is *always* a problem, always really matter if the garnish is religious or ""secular"", it's still saturated in emotional beliefs rather than objective facts, and that's why it is described as pseudo-religion. It follows the same social mechanics, the fervor, the ostracization of non-believers, the denial of objective facts for the purposes of The Party, the substitution of science with the same manipulations of brow beating or guilt-tripping or other forms of shaming.This is one end of [PC culture]( as an example of how bad it can get. *Abject* science denialism, rejecting dissent with manipulations according to PC ""rules"".If science is ""oppressive"" then your views are not in line with reality a lot of these people are marginalized. It's just not for the reasons they claim(skin, genitals, etc). It is because they are pants on head retarded. It's that they think being ""politically correct"" has any basis in reality over being *factually correct.* For this reason, there are some times when marginalization is called for. Same reason we marginalize other stupid ideas or ideologies which have the end result of being objectively bad for society(the intent is irrelevant).Why is intent irrelevant? Because good intent often has ridiculously bad results. Contrary to what these mental midgets learned in early life, it's not just ""the thought that counts"". It's the *impact*.There's nothing but good intent behind most anti-vaxxers. They don't set out to breath new life into virtually extinct diseases, but it is a very real potential impact of their suggested plan. Nobody really thinks they're the bad guy( barring and the like, as well as some epiphany about how they've made stupid decisions that got them into the situation they're in...Why? these are statistical outliers).""The greatest trick the devil ever pulled was convincing people that he didn't exist"" bears some merit in this case, and I say this even as an atheist.

"Being gay myself, this is why I've criticized the community's propensity to label every possible preference or presentation, it just confuses everyone and creates stupid and meaningless labels.

I've been told I'm because I don't like doing one night stands and I like sex more for emotional reasons (feeling close to someone, feeling loved and love the feeling of caring for a man) than I do physical reasons. Been told I'm fluid because I think some heterosexual erotica is hot. I've been told I'm an ""otter"" because I'm hairy but am too slim to be a ""bear"". Been called a ""stone butch"" because I fall on the more masculine end of the spectrum, prefer to be the dominant partner, and love taking care of my boyfriends. It's just stupid. Date who you like, wear whatever clothes you like, do your hair however you like, have or don't have sex, etc. Stop thinking every little thing needs a label. Also, kind of a side note, I just want to say how interesting it is how many of these people I see say ""not interested in cis straight men"". As far as I know, there's no inherent physical differences between straight, gay, or bisexual cis men, so it's clearly a political thing (trying to undermine cis straight guys), not an actual sexual preference.

"If this person found D&D so off-putting because of how the races separated themselves from each other, then it doesn't make sense for him to also be a huge fan of Tolkien's work. The different races in Tolkien's world barely tolerate each other, only cooperating when their literal existence is at stake. Elves live in their forests and shun travelers, and eventually altogether leave the world en masse because they find Middle Earth unbearable. Dwarves hole up in their mountains and lock the doors, eventually dying when something more powerful than them shows up to take their stuff. Men are either self-assured that they have no need of the other races, or are too busy trying to make a living to worry about other races. Orcs, trolls, goblins, and the like exist to fulfill their own primal needs of hunger, conquest, and bloodshed; for them, the good races exist only to be slaughtered, enslaved, and eaten.And the Hobbits want nothing to do with any of them.Most D&D settings are going to naturally be more homogenous than Tolkien's Middle Earth. I don't think that's a good or a bad thing, just that it is. But for this Tolkien enthusiast to pretend like he turned away from D&D simply because of how the races were segregated is absolutely absurd.",1

"1.) I'm happy that Breitbart managed to get and release this document. 2.) The coverage on Breitbart I checked so far (I did not read all their articles, I only looked at a few) has warped and changed meanings in several places. These are close enough that the sources provided seem to substantiate them, yet if you check the whole manual or look at the evidence provided critically you'll see it's either misleading or false in several 1: Breitbart: Trump, Conspiracy Theorist - [One of the reasons Google identifies for allegedly widespread public with internet free speech is that it ‚Äúbreeds conspiracy theories.‚Äù]( context: In [The Good Censor]( this slide is at the end of the section ""What‚Äôs the role of the tech firms in all of this?"", with previous slides detailing how tech firms are mismanaging the issues. Under this context the beginning of the slide ""When it comes to users, all of this bad behaviour and and then end ""... breeds conspiracy theories"" has a completely different meaning. Not that internet free speech is breeding conspiracy theories (as Breitbart says), but that the mismanagement of the companies (being intransparent about their algorithms and behavior) breeds such conspiracy stories by removing the ability from people to verify or falsify them easily. (I have to leave now, so only one example for now, I'll edit more in later).3.) In regards to the twitter reply by Bokhari you can see similar methods used. What is said is close to the truth in order to possibly mislead when not accurately checking, but false if you actually do check. One simple example here as well directly in the first tweet: >A few ""centrists"" (who unlike Evil Partisans, are unbiased, non-tribal, always correct and never wrong) have decided The Good Censor is fake news. Ironically, they base this claim on a video that spreads horrendous fake news in its first 5 the ""centrist"" point as /u/psa_sitch pointed out (but which can be forgiven as some centrists retweeted it), this is also a false statement. None of them claimed ""The Good Censor"" is fake news, they claimed that Breitbarts reporting of the story is false, biased or misleading.",1

The actual production company that makes the movies is [Dead Gentlemen Productions]( think. The exact nature of how the two companies are related doesn't seem to be entirely clear (that I can find with some casual *is* clear is that in the last few films, the content that they produce has started to take on SJW overtones. I know some people here [didn't like the last Gamers movie]( because of perceived SJW-isms, something that I [disagreed with]( at the it's gotten worse since then. ""Gamers Zero"" and ""The Gamers: The Shadow Menace"" (the former being a collection of shorts, leading into the latter film) went full-retard in their support for social justice. Several points include:* Magellan, a wizard who comes to Earth from the fantasy world of Fartherall (and promptly gives himself amnesia), unconsciously uses his magic to influence events in the 21st century. These include his causing the housing crash of 2008, coining the ""ethics in game journalism"" line, and encouraging Trump to run for President.* A new group of gamers includes an openly gay fat guy, who objects strongly to playing Rogar as being straight, despite Rogar being an existing character who is firmly established as being heterosexual. This results in Rogar seducing two male guards during a heist.* An Asian female member of that new group angrily objects to a comment someone else makes that she thinks is ""casual misogyny"" (I can't remember what the comment was).* A black guy in the new group is implied to have had a recent encounter with racist members of law enforcement. Because of this, he has Nimble (a white character) openly say (when he meets some enemies during a nighttime encounter) ""Greetings, fellow white people! Isn't it grand that I, as a white man, can encounter you here at night and *not* have my presence be construed as inherently Another member of that group, a white girl who is implied to be a lesbian, gets upset at the idea of The Shadow (the campaign's ultimate enemy) having kidnapped a princess, remarking that the trope was old when Super Mario Bros. did it, and that the princess should rescue herself. (She then has egg all over her face when she's told that ""Princess"" is the name of the five year-old daughter of another member of her party.)In short, the newest productions in the ongoing series (the two series share the same universe) seem to be going full socjus.

"Paging /u/psa_sitch to collect his beating.As a side note, one of Allum's criticisms here is something that was kind of a realization for me when I first started doing it.It turns out you *really can* just email the people directly and get all kinds of juicy info, or check facts, or tell them right to their face why you think they're wrong (politely, of course. Although... my emails tend to be incredibly longwinded with a shitload of links, so google sometimes labels me as a spambot).

Now you're hearing from a pro saying you're EXPECTED to send out these kinds of emails for this kind of work.

You're retarded."" Warning: 50% of the article is ads citing as a side note I didn't dig into this one and [got into an argument and uncritically repeated one of Sitch's talking points]( Also, got a response on my question already: Edit 2: Oh shit, Sitch DID email Bokhari: sent the author of the articles an email with my questions and concerns the day it came out and have yet to receive a response.... just... uhh... fuck me in the ass for getting on my high horse.

"I assume you're talking about US history (and leaving aside the gross and murderous injustices of the slave system, which is a book in of itself). Is she aware that voting rights for white men once involved property restrictions? Just as a random example, in Rhode Island in the 1830s, unpropertied men raised a militia and there was violence (Dorr Rebellion). It took decades before property restrictions were lifted for men. It was a slow and unsexy process, so your GF has probably never heard of it.There were plenty of men's rebellions against economic injustices. Ever heard of Shays' Rebellion? Broke out right after the American Revolution in western mainly poor farmers. Whiskey Rebellion? Poor farmers in western Pennsylvania had one item they could sell-- whiskey-- and the government put a tax on whiskey which was burdensome on them. They were not spared taxation because they were men. How about the Anti-Rent War in upstate NY? Poor farmers revolted against a kind of semi-feudal landlord system in the Hudson river valley.Is she aware of labor history? The US had a very violent labor history in the 1800s. Working people men) clamored for things like a 40 hour work week and weekends off. Does your girlfriend like having the weekend off? I assume she does. Does she think male capitalists freely gave their male workers days off *because they were men?* Did she read the book ""The Jungle""? Jurgis isn't exactly living high on the hog for most of the book.If you do your homework, you'll see that rights and benefits were never gifted out to common men, *qua men.* There was often a struggle involved. Powerful men do not favor less powerful men. The factory owner is more likely to spend his money on a fur coat for the wife than parcel out benefits to the men on the factory floor. This isn't rocket the leaders of the early women's movement at Seneca Falls were all comfortably middle class (at least) and had support from their husbands (oh *and servants,* they sometimes had servants too). For instance, Elizabeth Cady Standon and Lucretia Mott met at an antislavery conference in London; their husbands had paid for their tickets. It is a bit rather hard to claim that you're oppressed when your husband not only buys your steamship tickets across the Atlantic but *also* helps you to organize the first women's rights conference because you had no experience organizing conferences before. Right? If you look, you find all of the early women's rights heroines (who struggled!) *nearly all* of them came out of middle class households of the Victorian era.

">The project involves studying female engineering professors to ""lend critical insights into the divide"" that results in fewer women entering science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) programs.STEM field subjects don't appeal to women at a base level, and don't appeal to the vast majority of the general public at that same base level. This is because they require a level of scholastic preparation and understanding that is far above what the average person desires to spend, to the point that people who enjoy them consistently showcase similar symptoms to autism. There, I saved you half a mil; the NSF should've sent the check to me.Seriously, the verdict on the 'Women in STEM' argument has been available for years now, and the bottom line is that STEM shit just doesn't appeal to the vast majority of people, including the vast majority of women. It's hours upon hours of memorizing formulas and rote material, constant testing to ensure knowledge retention, and repetition ad infinitum. Yeah, anyone can go into STEM and learn it, but as someone part of it, while I would like to see more of anyone in the club, the journey fucking sucks. If you want more people in STEM, the education methodology needs to be rebuilt from the ground up, starting with Mathematics as it's the ultimate framework for the rest of the group, and then moving on from there. Good luck, however, getting old hats to change what clearly works in favor of appeasing the up-and-comers who tend to be self-centered and lazy.>The study seeks to upend current engineering and computer science programs by educating students and faculty on the ""benefits of diversity and required to foster welcoming environments for women.""Then this is not a study. A study collects and analyzes data, that's it. It isn't designed to push changes on its own; such action is supposed to be for those who wish to interpret the data that way. It's almost like this anthropologist is barely a legitimate professor and has no idea what her job is supposed to be (hint: it's not forcing personal ideologies on others for the sake of being able to give yourself a back-pat).>Due to the prominence and impact of ECS [engineering and computer science], identifying gender inequities in the field and interrupting them will help welcome and retain more talented women from a range of intersectional identitiesThe assumption that all women are talented, because that is what is being implied here, is beyond retarded and speaks to the general societal sentiment that too many people have been coddled into thinking they are This just in: you don't. Nobody matters until they make the personal decision to leave behind some kind of legacy. Such a thing is not a 'given', it's an 'earned', and had these people had parents who pushed them to compete via some means, they would've learned vectors of gender.""What an hilarious statement. Not only does this just sound ridiculous when you read it, because it's obviously the result of a stupid person using big words to sound intelligent, but anyone who has a decent vocabulary knows that the term 'vector' relates to pathogens and disease transmission, resulting in a statement that rounds down to 'intersecting diseases of gender'.>If anything, at least they aren't giving a lot of money for someone to study so... that's an improvement I guess?Perhaps, but the organization is still pissing away over half a million dollary-doos that's going to result in a highly-biased result that is woefully inadequate, confusing to parse, and rushed. What would have been a better expenditure would've been to host some sort of scholarship contest for kids entering into college involving some research project, where said students would have to produce a finalized report and analysis (properly supervised, of course). That way, you immediately separate the wheat from the chaff and find out not only who wants to go to college for STEM, but you also give young kids an exposure to real academic work to see if they want to actual make a career out of studying and testing. This gives them a chance to test the waters, rather than forcing them to make the decision in the middle of their transition and far more difficult undergraduate course work or, god forbid, at the start of their graduate course work because the college they went to didn't have enough funding to start proper academic research projects for undergrads.Or, shit, just donate it to an up-and-coming or buy a bunch of supplies and auction them off to programs that need them. Fuck, anything would be better than giving money that belongs to the sciences to a fucking humanities professor that unironically teaches shit like 'Queer Anthropology', as if the ancient human races spent any time coming up with statements like, 'Hmm, I woke up on the left side of the bed today, so I guess I'm a demi-gender pan-deersexual who has a penis, but that's hidden inside me and manifests itself via a vagina'.",1

"I don't particularly like commenting on here because I'm a lurker and not a huge fan of GG, but I want to set the record straight on this.Brad Wardell's politics have been known for a long time, and if people were review bombing him over that, the would have done the same thing to GalCiv 3, which they have not.Stardock is in the middle of suing the original developers of Star Control to prevent them from releasing a true sequel to Star Control 2 (which any reasonable read of all the stupid contract muck surrounding this whole thing indicates that they have every right to do). This is after saying on multiple occasions while they were developing Origins that they were ""staying out of the original Star Control universe so that hopefully Fred & Paul (the original devs) can make a true sequel some day"" or something to that effect.A lot of us Star Control fans were really excited that Stardock was going to be making a Star Control game, and we were *doubly* excited when Fred & Paul announced they were going to make a true sequel. At this point now (contrary to what Brad and his cronies are claiming), Fred & Paul can't even *start* working on their true sequel because they've got this lawsuit hanging over their head, and the settlement offer from Stardock says outright that they're literally never allowed to make another Star Control game again as long as they live.If Star Control: Origins is being review bombed, I can essentially guarantee you that that's the reason. The vast majority of the fan community would like to see both Star Control games, and many of us decided not to purchase Origins because of this ridiculous lawsuit*.",1

Summary: Rekieta Law goes through Lawyer Mark Zaid's extremely long motion to dismiss Richard Meyer's lawsuit against Mark Waid for tortious interference and defamation. Zaid claims Waid is not subject to Texas jurisdiction and does some extreme twisting of logic and words to reach that major hilarious points are1. Waid/Zaid claiming he has no business in Texas but he regularly attends conventions there and even offered to do business with the owner of Antarctic Press in exchange for them not publishing Meyer's comic book.2. Waid/Zaid claim that defamation was never done in Texas yet there is of Waid repeating his defaming points against Meyer at a convention in Texas.3. Waid/Zaid claim Waid did not initiate contact with Antractic Press. Waid's own Tweets and previous statement contradict this.4. Waid/Zaid claim Waid did not know Antarctic Press was located in Texas. Waid stated he knew the owners when he Tweeted he was calling them and called a Texas phone number.The lengthy livestream where Rekieta Law tears apart the motion and is in full rant mode can be found here: [,1

"So, ever the contrarian, I actually think the study is pretty good. I have plenty of things I disagree with, but it's clearly written with pretty honest analysis. I did manage to find a false positive listed as a Russian troll, but to be fair the guy was buying retweets and later deleted his channel and renamed his twitter, so it would have been easy to drop that account through the cracks.The biggest thing that I want to draw attention to is that the researcher has repeatedly expressed that anyone focusing on ""muh Russian Trolls"" is completely missing the point of the study, which details how the bots are a tiny fraction of a fraction, and that most of them have since been purged by twitter.In reference to he says ""This one gets it right."" an excerpt from that article:>None of that is to say this was Bay's intention. The 38 page research paper explains his methodology in-depth and with great clarity. He draws conclusions based on the dataset he has acquired and even states that it has ""limitations"" and the study is of a nature"". In his conclusion, he remarks that the assertions made within his paper must be considered only within the ""limited scope of the data set"".>He knows that makes for a less exciting worked as a journalist for many years, I know how the game works,"" he explains.>Bay is ""moderately disappointed in some of the major media brands"" that ran articles without taking the time to get a little deeper. He understands that some of his findings were buried because they produce a less enticing lede than ""Russian Troll Army invading the Star Wars just not what his research suspected Russian trolls are so few that it is basically the normal amount of Russian trolls you would expect to be present in a high-profile online debate.""And now for some tweets:>I don't come to that conclusion at all.**Some journalists have wrongly extracted that from the paper**. The paper just shows that there is deliberate happening, i.e. people are inserting partisan politics into Star Wars discussions now for different reasons. true. But having worked as a journalist for many years myself, I know the game. ""Russian trolls invade Star Wars galaxy"" is much more fun than ""Angry alt-righters use Star Wars fan discussion to vent political viewpoints"". Or ""On social meda, people are political"" üòÄ That's the real question, isn't it? And **if everyone could stop focusing on the tiny detail about Russian trolls in the paper**, they would find at least a partial answer in it: People fanning the flames for political reasons, even in SW discourse. all due respect to the journalist, the study actually says the opposite. There's only a small number of bots**, but an interesting number of trolls, and a lot of people with a political agenda. Also, I graduated, thanks üòÅ. has nothing to with it. Russian trolls are everywhere, they insert themselves in discussions all over the Internet and have done so for years. Star Wars fandom is just another venue. The paper is on deliberate of fandom in general, not just Russian efforts. the paper. That's not what it says. **Suspected Russian trolls are a tiny group within a larger one**. The Russian troll activities target anything where disruption can be made. But it's just a small part of the findings. this guy is low-key roasting journos and randos that didn't read the paper and are only interested in getting that juicy ""RUSSIA!!1!!"" clickbait, which, ironically is another component of how insanely political literally everything on twitter is these days (i.e. the thing he was ACTUALLY studying)As a final note, he's also perfectly willing to talk to people who have criticisms of the work, even tiny YouTube Channels:",1

Now, the phrase ""Polish death camps"" does tick me off, but almost no one who says it means it in the way that they were Polish-run, and if they do, they're usually just misinformed.

But it ain't going.""But it's taken too loooong""Cry me a fucking river over by CD Projekt, who've taken 8 years and 3 restarts to get Cyberpunk to a frankly similar state Star Citizen is at.What? You actually think that pre scripted video CDP put out reflected the actual state of the game? It's a mess of animations, script logic, half finished assets and T-poses. CDpro won't ever show that to you because it'd make them all look No company other than CIG will. Because CIG are stupid enough to show the warts and all. People think Game development is so easy.Now, I'm sure Cyberpunk will be a great game. But Game dev isn't all smart people making the best decisions and having the best outcomes. It's people. They make mistakes. The mistakes delay production, they fuck up because they have a vision that doesn't mesh with the stupid engine they chose requiring years of work to sort out. That ain't a scam. It's humans doing what they think is right for a project and being whether Star Citizen succeeds or fails is of no consequence to me as someone who only paid the bare minimum during the I have my concerns but people need to chill out. If the game doesn't come out, or it does and it's not good, you can tip your fedoras, massage your neckbeards and sit smug in the knowledge that you were right on the internet yet again.

You could maybe make case of SEED's ZAFT being such a case due to taking heavy inspiration from MSG Zeon but it also have some differences that make such claims harder to make. Gundam X's Space Revolutionary Army could be stretched to maybe fit due to again taking inspiration from Zeon but the series don't really focus much time on that faction so it's hard to know.I don't think you find such state in G, Wing, Turn A or 00, maybe cases could be made for AGE, Reconguista in G or Iron-Blooded Orphans I haven't completed them so I don't know but even if so that still plenty of series that lack such states which makes saying ""almost always"" a bit much.>Legend of the Galactic Heroes, a Japanese novel series adapted into multiple anime shows, also contains a similar government called the Galactic Empire.I wouldn't say the Galactic Empire is primarily inspired by a WWII-era Germany but rather 19 century Prussia or the German Empire with the focus on how important nobility is to advance in the ranks of the Galactic Empire. >Hetalia: Axis Powers portrays a group of countries with a sympathetic, Germany as the main character.

"I chose the gender option on my PGCE course as I'm a computer science teacher it seemed like an important topic with all that goes on in computing industry and there is a significant gender difference at the GCSE level (girls make up around 20% of the cohort). One of the things i found hardest about this topic was finding any fucking evidence to support any of the claims that were being banded around. So many of the papers i read seemed to consist of them waffling on a lot, citing each other, and not actually producing any sort of data. Some of the data was blatently cherry picked, some didn't even support the claims that the paper was claiming they found the whole thing a complete waste of my life, i scraped a pass. The thing that pissed me off the most though was talking to one of the others on the course who bashed out his assignment over a weekend, found some vague sources which supported what he was saying for references and got just short of the top mark bracket for it. I'd spent the best part of 6 weeks of my life when i wasn't on placement, reading papers and writing my own. a lot of them are still on my kindle from where i sent copies to it to read on the commute. In case anyone is curious, my conclusion is that the industry having a slightly higher ratio of females in tech jobs, than the ratio of university graduates, which in turn is slightly higher then the ratio of university applicants, which is compariable to girls taking the lower education levels indicates that there is no on the basis of gender, at least not at the industry level (individual companies may do, but its not a general trend) and if anything the numbers more indicate the industry making efforts to recruit and retain talented women where it could find them. This was supported by anecdotal evidence from recruitment companies who basically said skill women who could prove it could dictate their salaries and by the study which showed women have a 2 to 1 hiring advantage in stem subjects. I found a single study indicating that at the primary school level, girls and boys have a similar level of interest in technology (i think it was Finnish, which was apparent a mark against me, despite the fact i couldn't find any uk ones). Which by the time they are 14 has deminished to the point where they don't choose computing as an option. Despite the investment of huge amounts of resources, there has been no noticable change to girls taking up the subject. I was unable to find any data indicating at what point they lose it or why girls lose interest in technology, but felt that more research needs to be done on the 11 to 14 year old age bracket to investigate this trend.",1

"The well deserved hate for this sort of Tumblr style reporting on the BBC aside for a playing a game... on the internet... something MP or MMO which requires interacting with other people.For somebody to even figure out what gender you are let alone your race, you at least need to use some sort of voice voice communication might out you as a woman, depending on your accent/origin it's not inconceivable somebody might figure out you're black as well.Those are a whole lot of different things that need to fall into place though for that to be voice coms and nobody knows whether you're a green trans midget or a strong black womyn... and nobody gives a shit kinda one of the three salient points I want to make here...- Nobody gives a shit who/what you are.The second point is that in most competitive MP games people give each other shit.For the most part that means getting in the easy hits.You're a guy: that makes you a fag, gay, dick, asshole, etc... (A cunt in AUS)You're a woman: that makes you a bitch, a cunt, etc...You're black: Makes you a nigger, a coon, my second point is that:- people generally hit the low hanging fruit regarding insults and depending on the game you play - everybody gets insulted at some all that, even with voice coms, nobody knows whether you are straight, bi, gay, lesbian, trans, moonkin or whatever else...So even with voice coms, gender identity doesn't even enter into the picture unless you yourself make an issue of it.Which brings me to my third point:- Gamers will treat you as one of their own until you go out of your way to distinguish yourself from them and try to be anything other than part of the game.""I'm a girl"", ""I'm gay"", ""I'm trans"", ""I'm black"", ""I'm Asian"", ""I'm a Martian"" etc...Who cares? Gamers don't tend to care until you start rubbing it into their story short, as long as you put being a gamer first while you're playing games with other people, nobody gives a fuck what you do with the rest of your This became much more of a rant than I originally intended it to be and I'm not even sure I managed to get the point across that I wanted to get across...",1

"In America it will largely come down to a challenge for the first person that doesn't settle with a plea deal. Like with the masturbatory aid bans, which were also predicated on obscenity, it requires a court challenge to overturn obviously prohibitions on 1st amendment speech.Also, to anyone claiming ""muh 10th amendment,"" that only works for powers not already delegated to the people/fed. The 1st amendment, like the 2nd, is largely inviolable and cannot be constrained by state law just because they vote to do it. The states don't have the right to curtail 1st amendment speech that is guaranteed by the Constitution at large. Just because they regularly do, doesn't mean it doesn't also regularly get overturned after lengthy court battles.This is why states like California routinely get slapped by the Supreme Court for gross acts.As a further on this, keep in mind that ""nudie mags"" as a whole were considered illegal in the United States until recently, as far as history is concerned. When you see people say that something is illegal, you have to keep in mind that while the State may find it illegal, it doesn't mean that the court will when forced to examine it. Obscenity laws have been dying a slow death of a million court battles for decades, and no higher court *wants* to rule on something being an obscenity or not, because then they will have to once and for all define what an obscenity is without completely trashing the 1st amendment, a feat that they simply can't do, since the Miller test is the most ambiguous and ill-defined standard applicable.As a passing last time edit, obscenity law reflects possibly the last gasp of moralism in United States common law. The great majority of laws focus on the verifiable parties involved with a dispute, the verifiable harm or offense committed, and the verifiable damage of said acts. There is a lack of passion, or focus on right or wrong, in law. There is only what happened, and the facts about what happened. Only in the resolution of a trial does the depravity of a person's conscience in committing acts sway the punishment of those acts. But obscenity is ill-defined, lacks any victims, cannot be tied to a particular public act, and criminalizes the conscience of the accused. It is only ""wrong"" because others are offended by it. No act of deprivation is tied to its existence, nobody is harmed by its creation or and it can only be illegal because the State is making a moral stand. If anything, the world would be better by removing this topic from the State's hands once and for all.Obscenity law is the SJW's wet dream as created by the extreme right. There is functionally no difference between hate speech as envisioned by the extreme left, and obscenity law as crafted by the extreme right.",1

"Each of the waves of feminism has made them essentially the ""SJW""s of their time, including the suffragettes, who were the precursor to don't buy into the narrative that ""the previous waves are ok"" - they were all an example of movements with good intentions that had bad results and extremely bad actions. They got some of what they wanted but a lot of shitty things happened to society to get to where they wanted.For example, you can thank the suffragettes for winning the women's vote, but also forgetting to require women to enroll in the selected service *to* vote and get student aid, meanwhile ALL MALES are required to do so. Oh by the way, all rich property owners before the suffragette movement started were allowed to vote, INCLUDING WOMEN. The suffragette movement didn't fight for the rights of lower class or black women to vote either, just those of the bourgeois and upper class - does that fucking sound familiar to you?Also the suffragettes were *very* violent back then. Some of them behaved like the anti-fa of today.(I had to sift through the first page of left wing news sites APOLOGIZING for suffragette terrorism. Bugs the shit out of me that I have to pull up conservatives but hey, I never said I was a left winger, just a CENTER-left winger) channel is a real cool guy, MGTOW but not the ""women should lose the right to vote"" type.Anyway, what's going to annoy me is after Gen-Z grows up with its pushback of all this retarded socjus stuff, maybe 20-30 years from now we'll probably deal with another wave of this retardation, and I can't imagine how much more retarded that wave is going to be after this wave.

That's why his career is shit.The projection is too fucking real. Who the hell is this guy? I've never heard of him.

Mark's got my full support. Always.Okay, I'm done with the support tweets like this. This has nothing to do with the suit, it's just personal opinions of Waid. Moving on.> These fools feel empowered by the news of the lawsuit. Just wait until they get hit with the bright red cock of justice!Lol, what? This tweet will be hilarious if Zack wins.> because he‚Äôs the only one with the truth on his side. I look forward to the discovery phase of a trial that his bigoted, abusive opponent will end up paying for.The truth that he contacted a company he's not associated with to tell them lies about Richard? Still waiting for proof that Zack's a bigot.Zoe Quinn quote. She's irrelevant, she's writing a book for the Vertigo imprint which died, was revived, and thoroughly shit on.

"So here's an interesting tidbit in this article:>At GeekGirlCon this weekend in Seattle, six members of the Dungeons and Dragons team from Wizards of the Coast, the company behind D&D, described efforts to go beyond the stereotypes and appeal to more players, including women, people of color and even Each worked on the game during the development of its most recent edition, which launched in 2014.The paragraph in question doesn't say who the six women are, but later on is a picture of them, underneath which is a of the Dungeons and Dragons team spoke about their experiences working on the game and its effort to expand into more diverse player groups at GeekGirlCon in Seattle. It then names each of them: ""Left to right: Jaden Emme, Shelly Mazzanoble, Trish Yochum, Kate Irwin, Liz Schuh, Emi Tanji.""Okay, fair enough. But I wasn't familiar with most of those names, so I checked LinkedIn for their work profiles, since I was curious what role they'd played in designing D&D Fifth Edition. Here's what I found:**Jaden Emme:** I couldn't find a listing for her at all, on LinkedIn or anywhere else. I have no idea what her job title is or what role she played in developing D&D 5E.**Shelly Mazzanoble:** Author of *Confessions of a Part-Time Sorceress*, Shelly's bio on LinkedIn says that she's been an Associate Brand Manager at WotC since 1998, and moved up to Brand Manager in June of 2017. I'm suspicious of the idea that this involved much actual design or development work.**Trish Yochum:** According to her LinkedIn profile, Trish Yochum was a Senior Manager of WotC's in-house Graphic Design Group from 2000-2007, after which she apparently left the company for several other jobs as well as a long stint of She rejoined Wizards of the Coast as a Graphic Designer in April of 2018.**Kate Irwin:** Kate Irwin has been an Art Director for Wizards of the Coast since August of 2000. (Presumably this involved D&D and Magic: the Gathering both?)**Liz Schuh:** Her LinkedIn profile states that Liz Schuh has been Wizards of the Coast's Head of Publishing and Licensing for Dungeons & Dragons since August of 1995. Again, I question how much design and development this job Tanji:** Emi Tanji has, according to LinkedIn, been a Senior Graphic Designer for Wizards of the Coast since 2007, and an Art Director for WotC since February of 2018.So there you have it. Most of the women that were said to have ""worked on the game during the development of its most recent edition"" seem to have been involved with the artwork (which, to be fair, is a perennial hot-button issue for regressives) or were involved with licensing and brand management. At least one (Trish Yochum) doesn't appear to have been involved during the development period at all, unless she was an outside contract. (I don't have my 5E books with me to check.) Either way, aside from issues of the art, this really seems to be stretching the definition of ""involved.""So slightly more honest than normal for typical games journalism, I suppose.",1

And one of the thundercunts started laughing, and saying something along the lines of ""Imagine how funny it would have looked, just flopping around in the garbage disposal!"" and all of them except I think one were laughing, and that one chick had this ""This is it?"" look on her face.

"It's anecdotal, but thinking back over my life I find relatively few people who have done this. But the few who have, were women.Now don't or that. I'm 55 and have dealt with a LOT of people in my life who *could* have done such a thing. What I'm saying is very few people DID it. (The fact that those people were women in my case is only pertinent in this sense: I'm sure that that being a low-life cunt who try to steals credit is equally prevalent amongst women and men.)Now according to the 'article' this is because I'm a man, and that it happens to women a lot more. I submit that it was because when someone did it to me I read them the riot act and stood up for myself. Which is something that women should be able to do given that they have had the freedom to be 'strong independent women' for at least the last 40 years.So it seems to me that this article is saying that women are weak and unwilling to defend themselves.",1

"I have no comment on any of the articles written about the presentation, because I didn't read them. I formed my opinion by reading the presentation itself. I disagree with this video's assessment that the presentation isn't as bad as it's made out to be.The premises in the presentation are that censorship by the platform owner [is acceptable]( provided the rules and effects are clear, is [politically neutral, and focused on tone]( They see the platform owners as ""[hospitality organizers]( I reject these premises. For one, I don't see any more a ""hospitality organizer"" than I see my email provider: they provide a service by which I may communicate with others. The standards I use to communicate with friends are vastly different than those I use for business contacts, and I neither expect nor desire those standards to be enforced by the email these providers [already see themselves as politically neutral]( and focused on tone, so following those guidelines just gives us more of the same. And of course tone itself isn't politically neutral: see the censoring of the legal term [""illegal aliens""]( (though to their credit they appear to have backed off on that decision). Or the infamous ""gender pronouns"" debate. If I call a M2F transgender person ""he"", is that ""tone"" (and subject to censorship), ""political"" (and not subject to censorship), or a giant grey area subject to the whims of the censor and how they feel about me and/or the subject on any given day?Thirdly, being transparent about why you'e censoring someone doesn't really help the person being censored that much. We know exactly why The Daily Stormer was deplatformed: the GoDaddy CEO woke up one day and said ""I hate these guys and want them off my site"". When Alex Jones was deplatformed there were news articles and official statements on standby to tell us why it happened. When has such transparency ever answered more questions than it raised? You're still trying to polish the turd that is highly subjective standards with the shine of ""policy"" and what if I don't want these platforms to ""police tone""? So far they have a shit track record in policing their platforms; why should I trust them in the future? Earlier the presentation poses the question ""by what right do you do this?"". They try to answer it by saying ""well we'll only focus on tone"", but the question remains: ""by what right are you the arbiter of if there is a problem with ""tone"", why enforce a top-down, one size fits all approach to it? Why not empower the users with more advanced tools to filter things themselves (or for others with their consent) without removing the ""offensive"" material from the platform. Filter lists and moderated feeds could be services provided by users, for users and under the total control (including the ability to modify filter lists, opt-in/out of them, and ultimately disable all of the end-user. That way people can tailor their experience to suit their own sensibilities rather than having one standard thrust onto I love the use of ""family friendly"" terms. When Germany censors things it's to [""make online spaces safer""]( but when ""dictatorial leaders"" want to do so it's to [""improve their methods of control""]( And on the [page]( where they discuss flagging porn (which has regulations around providing access to children) and malware (which has quantifiable harmful effects) they provide a case study of The Daily Stormer (who was engaged in legal if unpopular speech) being taken off the internet, thereby trying to create a (strained) association between the three.",1

"Everyone points to Russia being the danger when it has an economy comparable to South Korea. Everything is directed at Russia when China is the one that is truly meddling with foreign affairs not just in the US and Canada but all over the world.Russia is a boogeyman that the Left prop up. While I think Russia has problems, if you look into Russian geopolitics and their history it's fairly easy to understand where they're coming from and what their motivations are. For example NATO conducts military exercises in Latvia which is right on Russia's doorstep. The US has put defensive missiles in Romania and as Putin pointed out, 'what's the difference between a defensive missile and an offensive missile? It's just the Russia and the Warsaw pact was still a thing, imagine if they managed to slowly get Central American countries into the Warsaw pact. Then they start conducting military exercises in Mexico. That'd be quite alarming for people living in America and would put them on edge.The Cold War ended in the early 90's and the USA has acted as if it never went away. Russians are merely trying to preserve their security which includes having buffer states. Russia likes having other countries either neutral or aligned to them between perceived threats.A lot of people don't understand Russia or Russian history. I feel like if we took more time to learn more about this supposed boogeyman, we'd be closer to easing tensions with them.",1

"This could be a little incoherent because I don't sleep much these daysI say that gatekeeping is good and proper. People build a little community the way they like it, and would prefer to keep it that way. It makes sense and is natural. Why would they want someone(s), who were not involved in the building, to come along and take advantage of what was created and then change how it is to suit the newcomer's taste? Which is essentially what's happened with any nerd fandom you were made fun of for in high school but now everyone wears the t-shirt because it's en vogueTo use your example of ""doesn't want smelly girls in their boys-only pillow fort"", how many of you, when you were kids, were forced to include someone you don't really like/know into your game, and they go about changing it or members of the group do so the newcomer I remember we were basically doing DnD LARPing when we were 10 or so and a kid the principal forced us to let him play with us didn't really get it. But he did watch the Kevin Sorbo Hercules show so he just wanted to be Hercules and beat shit up. Or a girl who turns your super hero fights into playing houseBut the more important question, I think, is how hard it is to get past the gatekeeper. In my experience, it's usually really easy to disarm people by asking genuine questions to show interest, and people generally like to feel like their opinions or knowledge are worth sharing. If you ask enough questions, and play some games to put the answers to those questions into play, suddenly you are a genuine member of the fandom, or you lose interest and leave, instead of being someone screaming at the gates to be let in come hell or high water, BAMNThat being said, gatekeepers should remain at the gates, and not wander around trying to test everyone. Speak only when spoken to about the topic and all that. And there are always more zealous you'll always find someone who has absurdly high standards before accepting you as a true member of the fandom. The important thing is that not everyone is like that. It's always annoying how quick people are to deny having traits attributed to a large group of people, yet are just as quick to assume everyone part of a group of people are all the same. I am sick unto death of all these ""x fandom is the most toxic fanbase ever"" type the more people that get added to a group, the more things get watered down. I don't know if it always has to be that way, but as far as I've it always has been so far. There is definitely a difference between hardcore gamers, casual gamers and people who fuck around on their phones. And if you like your gacha games, or your easy modes, or if wanting to gouge your eyes out is a normal part of a game's then that's fine. You do you. You don't HAVE to be a part of every cool thing that comes along, every trend and fad. Gaming is founded on git gud, same as sports, and I don't hear people wailing about needing to lower the skill level in sports. If you can't git gud in gaming, then become a spectatorSo keep gatekeeping so your preferred thing stays spicy, before it gets watered down to tasteless paste",1

Warning- there's a LOT of whining. I recommend going to 0:30 to see the slam. Yeah, she had hit the cop and obstructing him. So yeah, she should be arrested. No pass on obstructing and resisting just because you've got a vagina and you managed to not be overweight. Yeah, she was making it hard to put the cuffs on. But cops should be trained to determine how much force it will take to get an objective and to then not exceed that. Just because you've got the strength to slam a person's head to the sidewalk does not mean that it is the right thing to deploy when there's not any real danger in the situation (unless she starts clawing at the face). This could happen to your grandpa after he had four too many beers and wouldn't leave at closing time. It's not about gender or It is about having law enforcement that isn't trying to escalate just so they get a chance to relive their high school football or wrestling glory. I've had to fight my (more drunken than I, but not by a lot) brother on a sidewalk in Amsterdam once (note- New Years in Amsterdam is a lot of fun and I highly recommend against it). There are plenty of safe ways to put a person on the ground that don't involve risking damaging their football works by the principle that when you hit an opposing player so hard that he doesn't want to be hit again, he doesn't play as well for a while. We do not need to use this mentality in our policing. We can use it in the courts. But not on the streets. It DOES take more skill on the part of the cops to subdue someone without hurting them. Similarly, it takes more skill to body-slam someone than to just shoot then in the chest 9 times. We don't tolerate cops shooting people who are not an immediate threat. We require them to use something that admittedly exposes them to more risk and requires more skill on their part. Why should other extreme escalations of force (without regard for the subject's safety) be okay? This could be your grandpa.",1

Savage monkey beast,1
"Almost the entirety of this person's Tumblr is dedicated to blaming American capitalism for women's bad behavior, mental illness, drug use and so on. Lots of stuff about how women who act like sociopathic assholes to get ahead should be celebrated for doing it to ""survive.""I feel like she missed the boat. ""Stop dismissing [white] teenage girls and women! Let them exist! Pumpkin spice latte jokes are hate speech!!!"" used to be so hot on Tumblr. Now it's like, ""White women including myself should stop speaking and breathing so POC can be heard. In the time it takes you to drink your expensive Starbucks you can afford bc privilege, 1000 POC are killed. Their life is one of neverending pain. Flog me for my sin of whiteness."" (Am a ""POC"" and these people crack me up. Time to go back to my horrible life of fear now. I'm shaking.)",1
"This is the equivalent of being completely alone with another person in a completely silent room and letting out a deafening fart. When they look at you and say ""what the fuck?"", you just say ""what? I didn't let out that fart.""For real, they're either too dishonest or retarded to understand how their own ""where black pplz at?"" comment is a loaded question that implies racism. Nobody is that stupid and it's obvious to everyone else; you just look really stupid by trying to deny it.",1

"I know on this sub we rip on sjw's and their culture but really the vast majority of people who align themselves with social justice are like this one at least at first. They see a problem and want to solve it. They see people suffering and want to help them. They see oppression and want to do away with it. What a lot of them don't realize is that they can dismantle the things that they see themselves as fighting against without hurting those who they believe benefit from them. Dave Chappelle put it best. South Africa and the dismantling of apartheid should have been a blood bath but Mandela and his recognized that those who benefited from the system were also victims of it and doing away with the system demands between people, not destruction.",1

Even if she‚Äôs your friend, even if she said you two will be cool afterwards she just needs to blow off some steam. You don‚Äôt even want a 1 in 10,000 risk at that. Not worth it these days.

"Everyone pointed and laughed at the retards. The mainstream and local media parroted their arguments and games media kept making fun of them. The general public was telling them to fuck of constantly until there was an ESRB compromise. Which effectively just made the violent games more completely different imo. There's still a moral argument made, but it's one people have a hard time saying no to cause it's a secular moral argument. It's more manipulative on a larger scale. I wish it was religion doing this instead.",1

"I was considering making a very similar thread after letting the Monday business day pass, but I see you beat me to it.But yes, the Sony censorship story is very suspiciously apparently absent not only from the likes of enthusiast blogs like Kotaku and Polygon, but also the giant outlets IGN and Gamespot. One might rationalize this as Western journos not serving Japan-only news, but this hasn't stopped stories of similar scope before, like Japanese game announcements from Tokyo Game Show that may not necessarily get a Western release. Plus, this story very much has a relevant Western element to it, not only in that it will impact all future efforts to release Japanese games to the West, but also in that Sony's new censorious policy is being dictated by back further, there also appears to be little coverage of the latest Senran Kagura game being delayed and censored due to the policy, the first sign of the new danger. Of the four outlets mentioned above, it seems that only Kotaku reported on it.",1

"Her own facebook post, ran through google translate and might need some more adjustment - but anyone reading this should compare it to the actual movie above. Its WITH HATE CRIME MOTIVE On January 11, 2018, I was on my way home from work at 5.30pm. I was in a hurry to get the son from school closing at 18pm. I'm in a hurry, the train is coming soon. walk through the barriers. A white middle-aged man in front of me, turns around and stops me in the middle of the barriers and says to me ""go on your own card."" I stand between the barriers, they hit me hard in my back. He blocks my way. I ""But I have a card"", and is about to show him, but there is no time to do it.In the next moment, I feel how he grabs me with both arms, squeezes me hard into a corner at the latches, pushes his knee to my body, preventing me from touching and holding me with both arms. I get scared! I push him away with all my power. He gets pissed off and says ""damn dirty N-word hora"" while pushing me so hard that I trip through the barriers. A black man runs forward and tells the white man to stop ""Beat a Woman"".I'm both afraid, angry, offended, shocked, sad and desperate. The man continues to call me N word hora. I defend myself, strikes back! I refuse to be violated, afraid and depressed. Everything is recorded on video.The man reports me for abuse and I am making a counter notification of abuse of hatred motives. A week ago, I received a letter home that my application was canceled but the husband's application to me is not I'm suspected of abuse. My report is closed because, according to the police, ""it lacks objective evidence of support"". The male's application is not laid down !!The police's racism has already determined that he (white man about 185 cm) is the victim, and I (black woman about 163 cm) is above, despite defending myself in distresses and the man started the attack on me from nowhere!It's me who has back injuries, was hospitalized because of shock, got sick, got colleagues who follow me to the track because I'm afraid to meet the man.It's me who was attacked by unknown white man in the subway, and subjected to an afrophobic hate crime. The police never investigated my notification as a hate crime and they never registered the hate crime scene before my notification was Sweden, about 25% of all racist hatred is avrophobic. The most common hate crime against black people is a violent crime of unknown white man. I am one of those victims who carry on the damage of racism, afrophobia and hate crime that the police are kidding in.I am tired of the racism of the police, everyday racism, hatred and threats against black / brown people. I'm tired of 34 years in Sweden, to constantly bear the blame and become a victim of society's structural racism that permeates all authorities. I am sad that we who are exposed to racism never get settled. But the game must go on !!! SHARE GET! """,1

"IMO its as follows1, lack of quality in these outlets. Sorry, but if you are good at writing, you don't end up as game actual competition from indies - YT, Twitch - that are putting them out of business and therefore the necessary for clickbait articles in order to generate revenue (normal journalists don't earn much, game journos earn fuck all).3, Corporations blowing hot air up their ass so they can secure positive coverage that results in game journos massive ego trip issues (corporate exec tells me I am the greatest and maybe I have a future in dev team while my audience makes meme out of me because I can't play Doom). Hence why many of them are such massive cunts on social medias, while those that aren't generally see it as transit point until they either leave the industry for good or go indie.4, endresult is the identity politics agenda graivy train.

"My thought on this is that the sexes experience in different ways. Women generally seem to be more susceptible to and take more harm from sexualization than men, however this ""news"" page is extremely condescending towards both Kit and the fact that men ARE ALSO affected by even if not as much or in the same way as women generally are. It's like the bullshit about ""reverse racism"" and how there is no such thing as racism against white people, because racism is a social construct, etc. which is also why men can't be sexualized. It's a retarded, usually leftist (I'm a socialist in Sweden, meaning more of a leftie myself), blame game protected by hurling out racist, mansplaining, you-name-it type accusations just to keep someone with a slightly different opinion, quiet and make them feel overly privileged and ashamed. Just because you've been beaten up four times, and I ""only"" once, doesn't mean me getting beaten up is a non-existent problem and I should only care about yours.

Good. I think my biggest issue with these rape accusations is the time in between them. Like 30 fucking years? Get the fuck out of here those type of accusations shouldn't even be looked out without definitive proof. Bottom line if you get raped report it immediately. If you do not report it then it is YOUR fault the rapest doesn't get justice. Also all accusations without definitive proof should be looked at as false untill a thorough investigation is done. The accusations that have only dna and victim testimony as proof should result in both the victim and the accuser being put in lockup while a investigation is done. The victim and suspect should be cross examined Multiple times. This entire investigation should be private period. Any breach of that should result in harsh the penalty for false accusations should be considered a felony and carry at least 2/3s of a rapest sentence.,1

Is it true or not?>Stating that the court had found that ""the applicant's statements had been likely to arouse justified indignation in Muslims"" and ""amounted to a generalization without factual basis"", the ECtHR said that the woman's comments could not be covered by the freedom of to wikipedia there's a source that states precisely that. guess wikipedia must be also breaking the law.>The court said it ""found in particular that the domestic courts assessed the wider context of the applicant's statements and **carefully balanced her right to freedom of expression with the right of others to have their religious feelings protected,** and served the legitimate aim of preserving religious peace in Austria.""this is where it hits rock bottom, people can have whatever feelings they want for whatever reasons, you shouldn't be responsible for offending those feelings specially when you're stating something that is sourced.An example I've seen is how Galileo also suffered consequences for saying that the Earth orbited the Sun, that also helped protect people's feelings and preserve religious peace.At this point it's an outrage that such court ruling exists, if people can't criticize a religion or ideology then it should also should be against the law to promote such ideology as well as it might go against people's ""religious feelings"" and ""religious peace"".",1

And last night, I failed.One as regal as I, failing? Impossible. Only the gods could achieve such power to stop me. I guess that night I was dealing with a god.I'm on the YouTube homepage, trying to find some epic Morgz videos, when I stumble upon a certain video. This damn video. Its bright thumbnail, its captivating title - it utterly fascinated me. This cursed video: it was none other than ‚ÄúFortnite's most EPIC event EVER!‚Äù, posted by the one and only Ali A.My body immediately began to shake, and my penis shot straight up. The most EPIC event EVER? What could it be? I felt a pull towards the video like I had never felt before. It took me awhile to realize the effect the video was having on me. I fell back in my chair in fear. In agony. In complete and utter despair.My hand grabbed the mouse and began to slowly slide over to the thumbnail. I kicked and screamed and cried, trying and failing to stop my body. Sweat was dripping down my entire body. Minutes later, the pointer had finally reached its And with a cry, the hand that didn't feel like mine anymore clicked.I was immediately met with a scream. ‚ÄúTHIS IS IT LADIES AND GENTLEMEN!‚Äù Purple light streamed from the computer monitor and began to fill the room. The voice on the screen continued talking, seemingly in an ancient tongue. My entire body began to quiver as something awakened inside of me. My speakers began to shake as something inside of them grew louder. Was this music? Or was this something else?The music finally picked up, and as Ali's intro began, I came harder and faster than I ever had before. The sensation rendered me The last thing I remember seeing that night was my cum streaked over his face. And it looked like he was smiling.I woke up to a rising sun. My clothes were back on, my sweat was wiped away, and my penis was flaccid. I could finally see again. Was this all a dream? No, there‚Äôs no way. It felt too real.My suspicions were immediately crushed as I looked to the monitor. In a drunk stupor, it looks like I had changed my desktop background to a picture of him. He was staring into my heart - into my soul. And he was covered in my cum.So, guys, whatever you do, don‚Äôt watch Ali A's newest video. Anybody less powerful than I would surely be dead.

"It unreasonably grinds my gears when someone thinks that food becomes superior the more ""spices"" you add to it. And I enjoy spicy food. Cuisine is heavily based on geography, I don't understand how these people not get this. India didn't just decide one day to put spices on everything just because they were *that smart and knew that it would inexplicably make meat taste better*. They did it to preserve it! Warm climate + rain = bacteria, meat spoils quicker. Spices act as an antiseptic. Keep food fresher longer. Protect from harmful bacteria. You know how Russians pickle Same reason, except in their cases it's the cold winters that make them do this. Gotta have some way of preserving the vegetables. European cuisine didn't mix spices too much, it usually picked just one kind and added it a little bit to preserve the original flavor. Cultures like India added them in abundance, which resulted in an explosion of flavors. And honestly? Taste is subjective. It's just food. You eat it and then poop it out. Stop treating it like some sacred thing. Enjoy that sushi burrito, put sugar in your macaroni. You're not ""ruining it"", you're discovering new flavor God, did Ratatouille not teach you anything?",1

The factories got so bogged down by the lack of workforce that they started to pay (even in communism... imagine that) far better the manual labors than the university degree TESA workers.Years later, a 8 class low skill manual laborer (male) could afford a car (total decadent luxury) and yearly seaside holidays (another decadent luxury) while a high skilled university degree TESA worker (usually a woman) could barely afford to live....And the irony was that when the system collapsed, the working men, that got the best wages and best stuff (free holidays, free free food) were the ones to revolt and topple the system... not the shitty intellectuals from TESA that were too scared to do shit.So... even if you mandate it, you still gonna get shit back.

Yet I saw men in here who allowed their hate for one person to actually be ok with someone's life being destroyed based on a 30 year old memory with zero coming from anywhere.How men are being treated in the media, the biased judicial system, hiring quotas etc are all way more important than who you support a female who works in a male dominated industry, quotas can be dangerous and if unqualified people are being hired due to their vaginas, people can and will die.Sorry to rant, but hugs to you all. You aren't in this alone. There are a ton of us women who legitimately see what is happening and we don't like it either. So we are spreading awareness and speaking up any chance we get.

There is no studio out there, at least that I can think of, that is actually innovating in terms of the technology and mechanical design that the games are built from. Modern game development studios make great products, but that means teams are replaceable top to bottom. You need to prove to people you are irreplaceable by being too good to be let go, or you need to start your own studio so you can dodge this issue who was recently fired from ArenaNet after a dispute with fans over dialogue boiled over into a harassment campaign that successfully pressured the company into cutting her loose, knows all too well that game companies are unlikely to stand behind their employees under even the slightest strain.No company wants someone who has a history of being an unruly cunt, especially to its customer-base.

He recently graduated from the University of Oxford with a BA in philosophy, politics and economics, and has been raised both in the UK and Japan. He takes a particular interest in sociological approaches to international affairs."" Keep all that in mind while reading through the article, as while he does try to rebuff some of the more overt SocJus by the likes of the BBC or CNN (think ""RAPELAY RAPE CULTURE OTAKU OMG"" narratives), he instead tries to present *any* ""exotification"" of Japanese culture even by Japan itself as controversy over depictions of Aokigahara also shows that the issue of Japanese exotification stretches beyond media and into the film industry, and how what may be seen as benign exotification can become dangerous. > >What may currently seem ‚Äúbenign‚Äù exotification of Japan is perhaps best shown by the 2018 film *The Isle of Dogs*, which [stereotypes Japan]( using clich√© cultural symbols such as poisoned wasabi, sumo wrestlers and mushroom clouds, and even has a plot centered on a white character named Tracy who is supposed to be a white savior leading an uprising against corrupt politicians of ‚ÄúMegasaki,‚Äù a fictional city. > >It is as is if Hollywood never learned from the debacle that was *Ghost in the Shell*, which [whitewashed]( a remake of a famous Japanese movie by placing Scarlett Johansson as the ‚ÄúJapanese‚Äù protagonist and savior and built upon the image of Japan as a dystopian and futuristic society covered by neon lighting. > >A less spoken-of, yet earlier iteration of the issue was *The Last Samurai*, released in 2003, to an overwhelmingly positive reception, [despite its whitewashing]( lead role given to Leonardo DiCaprio and plot driven by myth that has embedded the view of the samurai as a blade-wielding ethical hero, despite contemporary Japanese society increasingly seeing the samurai not as a hero, but as a figure of corruption in Japanese history.Notice as well how the author tries to present himself as a gatekeeper and proper ""face"" of Japanese culture. Never mind how Japanese people loved the Scarlett Johansson film or that many in Japan itself still see samurai as heroes and historical symbols, among others. Never mind how the author unwittingly betrays how detached he is from his own country by invoking rhetoric and narratives that are almost a carbon-copy of Western SJWs and Adding.&#x200B;",1

Clearly money isn't being socked away in someone's offshore bank it has taken too long has more merit. But after the unexpectedly wildly successful kickstarter, the project manager asked the backers if they should similarly wildly expand the scope of the project... and most were in favor of it.

Offering a land claim token which will eventually allow them to choose land in the universe to gain legal (though imperfect) NPC protection for is silly.

"In the state of California an engagement ring is a promise! Not an gift. By law it has to be given back unless its after marriage. What a fucking entitled slut cunt!""In California we turn to a law dating back to 1939 which specifically addresses engagement rings and other gifts in of Code section 1590; it states: Where either party to a contemplated marriage in this State makes a gift of money or property to the other on the basis or assumption that the marriage will take place, in the event that the donee refuses to enter into the marriage as contemplated or that it is given up by mutual consent, the donor may recover such gift or such part of its value as may, under all of the of the case, be found by a court or jury to be just. In this case the ""donor"" is the person (i.e., the man) giving the engagement ring, and the ""donee"" is the person (i.e., the woman) receiving it. A gift in of marriage can be revoked, unlike other gifts. Thus, California law is very clear on what happens to the ring - if the woman calls off the wedding, it goes back to the man. Also, if both parties agree that the wedding is off then the man gets the ring back. This California law has wide ranging impact for property given in of marriage. In an important case on the subject - Shaw v. Shaw (1964) 227 Cal.App.2d 159, a man and woman lived together for four years. He placed her name on real property because he relied on her promise that she would marry him when her divorce was final. The couple separated before marrying and the woman eventually married another. The court awarded all property back to the man because she failed to marry him. This has an impact on our society today because of the number of couples living together before marriage.""",1

Long term the strategy will fail, the media will portray him as a monster and throw heaps of free publicity at the company will inevitably try to start.

"> Actress Keira Knightley went on the Ellen Degeneres show on Tuesday and said that her daughters are banned from watching Cinderella and The Little Mermaid, why? Because she wants her daughters to know she doesn‚Äôt need no man‚Ä¶no really. She stated that those films send the message that women should wait for a handsome prince to rescue them or that women should give up everything for a you know, she waits around for a rich guy to rescue her. Don‚Äôt! Rescue yourself, she fucking doesn‚Äôt watch the damn takes her fate and life into her own hands and sells her voice for legs to go get the man she wants. Eric doesn‚Äôt save Ariel from *shit* ‚Äî she saves *him* from drowning and then wants his dick. Stuff happens on land, Ariel breaks the agreement, and then Ursula takes Ariel captive per the terms of their contract, but King Triton ‚Äî Ariel‚Äôs *father* ‚Äî offers himself in her place, and then Eric and Ariel *work together* to kill Ursula and save Triton and the world.Keira Knightley is banning her daughter from watching a movie that features a female protagonist who retains complete agency for almost the entire movie and directly drives 100% of the action because she herself has evidently not seen the movie and knows nothing about it. The core message of Disney‚Äôs adaptation of The Little Mermaid is that pursuing your dreams is *hard as fuck* and any number of things can go disastrously wrong ‚Äî including things that will be *your own fault* for trusting the wrong people or taking the wrong approach ‚Äî but that if you don‚Äôt take on that risk and that then your chance of achieving your goals is movie didn‚Äôt kick off the Disney Renaissance by being shitty or backwards, it did it because its themes resonate at a fundamental archetypal level. It‚Äôs teaching you a lesson you‚Äôve always known but that you forgot, one that‚Äôs equally vital to anyone and everyone regardless of identity group. It‚Äôs a great movie and fuck you for denying it to your kids.> Disney cartoons are not supposed to teach your teach life lessonsThe best ones do teach you life lessons, they just do it subtly and almost subject to (well okay Zootopia‚Äôs aggressively unsubtle but it‚Äôs still very thoughtful about its subject matter and is still chiefly telling a story first before teaching a lesson).

That's not how statistics work! Honestly, I feel bad for these people. They seem to honestly think that our culture condones rape. I'd be pretty nettled too, if I believed that. I'd probably be rather stressed out all the time if I lived in the Middle East. The argument that makes sense is that sometimes protect rapists because of the status of the rapist. But the thing that people miss is that *everyone hates when do this*. It's not like a college protects it's star running back and everyone's like ""welp, all's well that ends well."" No, people lose their fucking minds! People still talk about *Brock Turner* because he got off too easy on a rape charge. People ought to start asking college kids what needs to be done to eliminate rape culture, so that we could get better insight into what they think it is. It's inevitably going to be something like ""we ask women what they were wearing"" or ""people who get accused still have running water"". It's completely from reality.",1

That's because he realizes raising his son takes time and effort, as well as money. He supplies everything he needs- haircuts, school clothes, lunch money- and when he was younger, we even went in on Santa gifts together, regardless of whose house he spent Christmas morning at. He does all of his pickup and drop off on his weekends without (much) complaint. It's about my son, and the fact he's raised right. Not about money. 2800 a month is a big paycheck already.

No business is obligated to offer services to someone with whose views they don't agree, and though I would prefer this not apply to payment providers (whose only service is moving money around), unfortunately it does.The Unruh Civil Rights Act they cite makes no mention of political affiliation. It specifically outlaws discrimination based on sex, race, color, religion, ancestry, national origin, mental or physical disability, age or medical condition (including HIV status). HOWEVER (and this is what Jones is banking on) the California Supreme Court has held that the protections of the Unruh Act are not restricted to these being said, extending its protection to cover what can be characterized as conspiracy theories and related nonsense is going to be a really hard sell.

"This is something that echoes a bit with me as you see the same thing between tech industry and science. Employers love to write off long work days to be something proud about but to me it's really exploitable and just a deep flaw of various cultures (it's a global phenomenon, really). On reddit, far too often when I warn peope to not simply accept working 60+ hours on a 40h a week contract, they get very defensive and claim everyone else is lazy.The 40h/week standard is that way for a good reason. You need a healthy work-life balance. You will likely be busy enough just having a household and aside from that your brain and body need to rest. To push your body beyond without receiving extra payment and the choice to refuse is But it not this way, especially not for startups in science and tech both and also academic positions, already starting at the PhD level. Hell, I too am expecting to graduate with my doctorate in a little over a month, but I for sure had 50-60h on average for a 40h a week contract. It is the norm despite seemingly scamtastic. Two things need to happen: we need to stop glorifying destroying yourself physically and mentally for the pockets of your employer and people need to unionize more or start getting more with programs which protect worker's rights. Germany has good unions, but the same cannot be said of france, NL and the US. And especially for you americans out there: I as a european cannot believe that you can find work without having a legal contract! Making it mandatory to have a contract should be the first step in making things better. A contract is not there to limit you. It is a way to protect your rights and prevent your employer from exploiting you. You have a legal document you can at all times refer back to and nobody can debate it. In france (and I think NL too) at the very least for overtime you are obliged to be paid extra. People I know let me know that sometimes they are send home after their 8h shift is over purely due to the fact that the employer does not want to pay them more. Edit: Due to some comments on this: Of couse it's very reasonable to have a crunch busy period and expect to work a lot, then have periods where you are not busy at all. I am not saying we shouldn't ever have crunch periods. However, we should avoid them when we can and not encourage employers to chronically understaff because they know they can get away with long term giving people 60h work weeks on 40h contracts.",1

I, too, openly question some of the views he expresses on twitter, like many of you on this forum. But you know what? it doesn't really matter. It doesn't matter if he and I don't agree on anything with regards to politics, if the man himself is so obviously full of integrity and his views don't really matter, I'll listen to what he has to say. That's the real trick, if its Anita Sarkessian, it doesn't matter what the message is. If she did a video on the long term benefits of flossing, I'd probably skip picking up floss the next time I'm at the drug store and might question the very foundation of dental hygiene as a science. The messenger often matters as much, if not more so, than the message. If Anita says it, I'm not listening, period. If Alexandria promotes something in a campaign stop, I'm going to assume its dumb, stupid and na√Øve and not give it a serious thought. Those people can't get through to me. If Tim Poole says it, then even if I disagree with it, he has more than enough credibility with me that I'll think about it, do some research and try to figure out where he's coming from.

He was immediately downvoted to oblivious and berated, with one poster saying she was going to tag him as a manipulator. Just because a person doesn't see confidence as humanity's final form doesn't mean that person is some sort of sleazy guy trying to play on girls' insecurities. Shyness is cute, and allowing others to see when you're unsure of yourself can be a better quality than pretending you know what you're doing all the time.",1

When you hold views, you are creating more problems than you are solving. This was a bunch of dust that did not need to be kicked up, but you went and did it anyway - and for what? I apologize if this is a real issue for you and I do not mean to offend you, but you also have to look at the bigger picture here. The world is nuanced, and as long as you continue seeing it in black and white you become just as despicable as the very people who have originally made this such a horrible issue as it is in the first place today. Extremists are extremists - period.

And also - you attacked someone who is VERY much against extreme religious crap that a lot of people try to pull - and who could've been an ally and an advocate for you on this issue - but instead of trying to see from his you forced him on the defensive immediately and lost him completely on the issue. When you do that, you're not helping your cause at all - you're pushing people AWAY from it.

"Despite having a trans girlfriend, I‚Äôve been lurking meta since I discovered it this spring. I generally agree with most of the viewpoints of the posters here, from gun control, the insanity of the left, the anti illegal immigration sentiments, JT, Pro Bernier, affirmative action, etc. Even on a lot of the trans issues; regardless of how I feel about my gf, i totally get how it‚Äôs weird to most people, and I frankly have no issue if you want to call her a man. I mean, it‚Äôs an asshole move and lacks grace if you do it to a person‚Äôs face, but I won‚Äôt hate you for it, I get it (I‚Äôm a huge Shapiro fan, and he does not mince words on the subject). Im Pro Jordan Peterson (as is my trans gf)But I will guess that most of the ‚Äúhate‚Äù towards trans people on meta is coming from people who have never actually met or had a with a trans person. Like any segment, there are crazies, and likely a higher percentage than in gen pop, sure. But calling trans people mentally retarded and saying they can‚Äôt do a job that has nothing to do with their gender really is pure hate. I would never say you folks don‚Äôt have the right to say it, I‚Äôm a free speech absolutist, but you do nothing but hurt your side of the political spectrum. Yes, the left is filled with hate at the moment, but you are just continuing the cycle and turning away folks like me who are on board with most things that the PPC party champions. It‚Äôs fine to have your opinion, but to have that much hate for people (CANADIANS) you have never met is telling more of you than of them. Not all trans folks are activists trying to change our society, most I have met are actually the opposite; opposed to the activism, they don‚Äôt want that spotlight, they just want to lead normal lives. There currently isn‚Äôt any that helps trans people as much as actually does, until that time this is in a lot of cases the best course of action for a happier life.I would also like to note, that not all trans people are actually legit gender dysmorphic, I have met a few that are straight up flaming gay dudes that took it too far. You know what that means, being able to tread that line?It‚Äôs called nuance, something sorely lacking on both sides. I hate the crazy left, but the vitriol from some here is just as bad. Nay, it‚Äôs worse. The left can at least claim their insanity is out of ¬´ feelings ¬ª and ¬´ justice ¬ª and ¬´ equality ¬ª. All you folks have is hateTo the bigots on here",1

"**Here's a trailer / store review (or personal impression, if you will):** The first contact with your game is through its title and short and they already tell me this is a politically charged game, and that the game takes a clear side in the culture war. At this point, I heavily suspect it will be heavy handed and preachy. My suspicions are reinforced after I start watching the video, as it contains too many ""buzzwords"" which makes it seem like it's a game aimed at die hard anti-SJWs only, and makes it feel too forced. Should be more subtle with these things. The action and the written explanation on the store is not good enough to convey what the gameplay is about to most people. You should show and explain better the game mechanics. If people are confused about your game from the get go, they wont even bother downloading a demo, much less buying it to try and refund if they dislike. The FAQ has a better but most users will not go out of their way and delve into the forum to try and figure out a game whose first impression was ""being weird"", or ""confusing gameplay"".I obviously didnt play the game, but the feeling I get from the material presented is that the SJW theme is just a skin that could be ripped off from the game and it wouldnt change the experience one bit, or even make it better from not feeling so forced or preachy. It feels like an after thought since it doesnt seem like its integrated to the gameplay aspect of the game. You could turn this into an office battle royale themed around office rage and work and it would be all the same, or possibly work better.I don't mean to sound harsh or anything, these are just my personal, unfiltered thoughts from my first contact with the store. In this context, my personal reaction would be to click ""not interested"" and ignore it. Your game is competing for attention with not only thousands of others, but also with the backlog of each steam gamer. Your first battle is to grab the interest of the public to keep looking at your video or reading your Your second one is to aptly convey what your game is all about, how it plays and instill a desire on the user to go out of their way and buy it in a short video and / or As it is, the store lacks hooks and incentives for that. i wish you good luck.",1

"Prosecutors have decided not to charge Long Beach Councilwoman Jeannine Pearce with domestic violence or driving under the influence in connection with a June clash with her former chief of staff.But a district attorney‚Äôs memo detailing the decision also raises questions about the Long Beach Police Department‚Äôs response to the June 3 incident involving the councilwoman and Devin Cotter.In its initial statement, the Police Department said it received a call for assistance from the California Highway Patrol about a possible drunk driving incident on the shoulder of the 710 Freeway in Long Beach at 2:40 a.m.The city‚Äôs officers smelled alcohol on Pearce, who admitted to drinking that night, according to the district attorney‚Äôs memo. A field sobriety test conducted about 4 a.m. showed she was mildly impaired.But the memo said a test of the councilwoman‚Äôs blood-alcohol level was not conducted until 4:20 a.m., nearly two hours after the CHP called. At that point, the test showed Pearce had a blood-alcohol level of 0.06%, under the legal limit of 0.08%, the memo said.The testing device used on Pearce was unreliable, the prosecutor‚Äôs memo said. A department toxicologist had recommended it not be used a month before the incident. Additional tests were not performed, according to the district attorney‚Äôs memo.A police spokesman said in a statement that officers initially investigated whether domestic violence had occurred when they arrived, interviewing Cotter and Pearce before realizing that the councilwoman had been drinking. At that point, the officers called for a colleague who is a certified drug recognition expert to investigate, Sgt. Brad Johnson said in the statement.He said the testing device had been ‚Äútagged to be replaced but was not removed from its storage cabinet. The officer who retrieved the device did not realize ... and unfortunately used it during the DUI at the scene saw Cotter with swelling, redness and a cut to his head and cuts to his hand, according to the district attorney‚Äôs memo. Pearce at one point had shoved Cotter, causing him to fall to the ground, the memo ultimately decided that Pearce, who was elected to the City Council in 2016, could argue she was defending herself when she shoved Cotter.In an email to The Times, Pearce said Cotter had thrown her ‚Äúkeys, iPad, and many other things‚Äù off to the side of the road during the argument on the freeway shoulder. Asked about the delay in time between the arrival of responding officers and the administering of a sobriety test, Pearce said she was questioned about the confrontation with Cotter for ‚Äúsome time‚Äù while the investigators were ‚Äúwaiting on someone that was bringing the who could not be reached for comment, served as campaign manager for Mayor Robert Garcia when he was elected in 2014 and later served as a legislative deputy to him until July 2016, according to Cotter‚Äôs LinkedIn page. He then left to work as Pearce‚Äôs chief of staff until February 2017. Pearce and Cotter had ‚Äúdated before, during and after‚Äù the June 3 incident, according to the district attorney‚Äôs memo.The two had been driving back from a concert, where both had been drinking, when the altercation occurred, according to the memo. An argument ensued, and Pearce struck Cotter on the arm because he was ‚Äúcausing the car to dangerously swerve‚Äù on the freeway, the memo said.Both gave ‚Äúmultiple inconsistent statements and thus both have proved to be inaccurate reporters of fact,‚Äù Deputy Dist. Atty. Janis Johnson wrote in the memo. But evidence supported the councilwoman‚Äôs final version of the events over Cotter‚Äôs, Johnson the evidence was a text message Pearce sent to her new chief of staff asking for help and a video the councilwoman took that showed Cotter yelling a threat to release disparaging information about her to ‚Äúthe press, her husband and her employer if she did not meet certain demands while holding her car keys,‚Äù Johnson wrote.Long Beach police previously said officers did not find ‚Äúsufficient cause‚Äù to arrest either Pearce or Cotter at the scene. Pearce was driven home by a friend, according to police, and Cotter was taken home by the responding tried to confront Pearce again hours later outside her home, the councilwoman said. He was arrested on suspicion of public intoxication a short time later, according to police.In a statement released earlier this year, Pearce said she had been the victim of domestic violence in the months before the incident and that police were investigating, though she did not accuse anyone by name.‚ÄúSince late last year I have experienced escalating threats, harassment and stalking,‚Äù she wrote.Pearce said those incidents remain under investigation by Long Beach police, and she declined to elaborate Thursday. She also expressed frustration that she had been cast as the aggressor in the incident.‚ÄúI find it frustrating that as the one that called [police], that was trapped, and was faced with fear that I was listed as the only suspect in the matter. This is one example of the challenges for women (and even men) in speaking up about psychological abuse,‚Äù Pearce wrote in the email. ‚ÄúThe burden of proof is not a bruise on the outside, ones easily seen.‚ÄùPearce has said she was not ‚Äúpulled over‚Äù June 3, but had requested a police presence at the scene. Earlier this year, CHP‚Äôs Southern Division Chief Chris O‚ÄôQuinn told The Times that his officers came upon Pearce and Cotter because they were involved in a ‚Äúheated argument‚Äù on the side of the freeway.Long Beach officers have closed their investigation into the June 3 incident, according to a statement released Wednesday. The district attorney‚Äôs Public Integrity Division is still conducting a separate investigation into ‚Äúalleged inappropriate activity and conflicts of interest‚Äù in connection with the incident. A spokesman for the district attorney‚Äôs office declined to elaborate.",1

But damn not even a chance for parole after 40 years? 60 years guaranteed in prison. Her life is absolutely over. R E K TYet so many others get away scot-free.

This is seen in the report under issues.""This is an interesting case when you dig a bit deeper regarding their law. On one hand, I kinda get why they do this because it's a legal issue. The age of the two main characters here are 16 and 15 and this, **correct me if I'm wrong here**, is considered child porn. Although The UK age of consent is 16, The specific issue is that a 16 year old legal is having sexual relations with a 15 year old who is still a ‚Äúchild‚Äù, a depiction. that they would not want to stick their 2-inch pole in this deep, troublesome hole. On the other hand, the real issue lies with the stupid laws and provisions that are in place. They are drawings. Fictional characters. They are not real ~~just like your for as long as they're drawn. Just because a creator of a work has labelled characters a certain age that should not mean anything. The laws in UK and the general populace mindset regarding this thing need to change as they still treat drawings as having the same rights as a living, breathing, normal people.

These include a $77,229.28 cashier's check ""used to pay off a BancFirst loan in the name of Cindy Smith in 2015."" Another was a withdrawal posted to the victim's account in October 2017 in the amount of $29,371.86. That was a payment ""made to Honda Financial to pay off a 2016 Honda Accord that was registered to Cindy Smith."">The documents allege that in August of 2017, a $10,000 cashier's check from the victim's account went to Emerald Springs Spas ""for a down payment on a hot tub"" that was set up at residence. The total price of the hot tub and accessories was $14,489.10. Smith-Frawner also took out a loan for the remaining balance from the Oklahoma Educator's Credit Union, then a month later, $4,682.39 was taken out of the victim's account to pay off a loan at the Oklahoma Educator's Credit Union.>Then, in October 2017, $295,000 was transferred from the victim's bank account to her personal account, one the victim did not have access say the total equaled over $450,000.

"Forgive me, it's late, and I haven't slept.The BanOut: 2018 initiative targeted racist right wing subreddits to shut them down. The questions are: 1: What constitutes as racist, as there is a legitimate problem with the left calling those that don't agree with them racists, or even citing factual accredited statistics as racist.2: Were any anti-white, or other racist pages or accounts targeted? Is there a list available of the subs and users targeted by BanOut so that we can go see for ourselves what the racist content was that warranted banning?The fact that this BanOut initiative goes *at least* all the way to upper management in Reddit staff, Director of Policy at Reddit, Jessica Ashooh, who comes from a pretty questionable background in this instance; so that means that Reddit in some regards supports this initiative, and being they're a left leaning site, that's concerning, but not all that coupled with you ""contacted a certain admin to let him/her know what I was going to do."" This admin who also works for left leaning Reddit, gave you the go ahead to troll the BanOut initiative to get it shut down.

Everything (pertaining to my questions above about what constitutes as racism) that was targeted and banned by BanOut is still banned. No subs have been restored, no users reinstated.

This makes 1st worlders harder to control and harder to oppress than 3rd worlders, since 3rd worlders are used to being by the state, and 1st worlders aren't. It's by design that our system produces people who are hostile to tyranny. That's an essential feature of our civilization. But that's an obstacle to [the powermongers in our midst.]( The 1st world ruling class are jealous of the 3rd world ruling classes because the 3rd world dictators have populations that are completely cowed and feel subordinate to the ruling class, which gives the ruling class absolute power. The 1st world ruling class want that for themselves, [so they're importing it by the boatload.]( Soon they'll have enough to outvote the original 1st worlders, and our ruling class will finally have the 3rd world dictatorship they've always dreamed of.

"Rule 3 summary, because the mandates it and we do what the says: Star Trek discovery is in a bad place. Its in the same sort of a place as a highly touted first round draft pick of your favorite sports franchise is after the GM and the Coach who drafted him have gotten fired. Think Current Lakers' Head Coach / Dead Man Walking Luke Walton. The sign-up numbers for CBS all-access are bad. They went down after STD came out (according to an by the video in the OP). My Comic Book Store Guy is fond of saying this about digital comics. For over a decade now, everyone in comics has been told that digital is the wave of the future and that paper and ink don't have long to live. Yet, every single month, the digital outlets call my CBSG and try to convince him to hawk their products. As my CBSG is fond of saying, if you don't know what the numbers are for digital comic sales (and no one does) that means they're bad, because if they were good, you would never hear the end of it and those sales numbers would be highly publicized. If you're not hearing CBS talk at great length about exactly how strong CBS all-access growth is, that means the numbers are dismal, because if the numbers were good, they would never stop talking about it. Now, it appears the first five episodes of STD season 2 went way over budget, because what was screened was received horribly and reshoots were ordered. Think Justice League, think Solo: A star wars story. Now, Les Moonves, who was the champion of STD at CBS, and those who are loyal to him on the board, are out. CBS can cancel STD and Moonves takes the entire blame, and the new board gets to write it off. The leadership that backed STD being gone removes the Sunk Cost Fallacy for eliminating this piece of trash. The new Picard series (which I'm not yet sure how I feel about) being provides a replacement The shorts were made to be sold to as a way to generate some cash to cover STD's losses. Netflix has not liked the performance they got from STD season 1, and they are not backing season 2. They made the shorts, and no one wanted them, much like no one asked for STD in the first place. Everything about STD rubbed me the wrong way from the very start, I'm glad its on life support and I'm glad it will soon be cancelled.",1

"I think one of the big things is that feminist types want to see only fantasy that makes them feel good about themselves, while me (and I assume a bunch of others) want to experience stories. Flawed characters who hit close to home may not always make you feel good about yourself, but they make you think, they give you more than just the creator trying to flatter the idealised self you imagined for yourself. Now many of these people say things like ""so you can believe dragons and not muh but they don't understand that it's different. We need to connect to the characters and honestly, a lot of the time people connect to others because they understand their pain. My example is Harry Dresden, because I am a huge fan and know my shit. So. Many feminists hate his character. But here is the thing, I connect t him because I am similar. Sure, he is a man, a wizard and detective, I'm a woman, trainee at a dental lab and generally a pussy when it comes to physical danger. But he makes fun of himself, like me, he has this huge sense of justice, like me, he gets in trouble because he can not just bend the knee and spit on his morals, like me. The pitfalls of this character are similar to my own problems, just amped up and with magic. I could get him. I do not say you all need to be like him or me. But I can feel a sort of fictional Not trying to make it sound like I am some brilliant person, I am not. But when I participate in the stories of Harry Dresden I have to look at myself from an outside perspective and I have to acknowledge our shared flaws. It takes some which a lot of the more SJW-inclined people don't do, because it makes them So lets just take some women's march gender studies girl, with pink hair, who is vegan and freaks out a lot about random first world things. She will not be content with a character like herself, who would probably not be the biggest female warrior, strongest of them all.

Personally as an artist I do think ""sameface syndrome"" is a valid complaint. It's an flaw for beginners or for a single artist who is self taught, but when a studio with dozens of artists on a single project make their female characters too similar looking (not identical) but have more extreme differences among all the male characters, then there's obviously some bullshit going on with the blizzard execs.",1
"From 4chan:* [ [ [ it's a perfect storm.1. The left is reeling. The left in America has a near religious worldview. Everyone agrees with them. They're so, soooo smart. The smartest ever. They're the party of good ideas and civil rights and that means that they have a monopoly on those issues. And that means that everyone not them is the exact opposite -- Stoooooopid rednecks who hate everyone and will never amount to anything. The US is liberal and thanks to Obama, we've entered a liberal golden age and the GOP will have to spend the next 30 years out in the wilderness until they learn how to be DNC-lite.... Wait, what do you mean she lost? Wait, it's Trump? And he's doing a good job? *And half the country agrees with him?* That doesn't make any sense! There MUST be something wrong with the country and reality itself, because lefties *can't be wrong.* 2. At the same time you have them having this mental breakdown due to the world refusing to confirm to their fantasies... You have their reaction being organized protest. Heavily organized protest, to the point of being basically glorified mob actions. And the way the left does this stuff is they synchronize the protests. Very effective... but it makes it hard to ignore the fact that you're all things. Remember when we called them Snowflakes and they got pissed? It touches on an unspoken assumption. The lefties might all have the same beliefs and might all say the same things and might all be wearing the same pussy hats and might all be carrying the same printed signs, but *they are all unique individuals* who happened to come upon these exact same points/etc because **they're just that smart.** The NPC meme points out that, well, they're not getting all those ideas from their own galaxy sized brains. They're getting them from, well, indirectly from Soros mostly, but from alpha lefties who hand them out. The Rachel Maddows and the ShareBlues and the Media Matters of the world. And on some level... they know this. And it makes them feel really, REALLY uneasy. 3. Finally, you have the fact that the NPC meme is people mocking the left. *Mocking.* **The left.** The left, which is comprised of the best of humanity. The left, who are smarter than everyone else. The left, who have the most perfect golden morality and ethics and beliefs. ***How DARE you!?*** And yet... everyone is.So, a perfect storm - poking several deep seated insecurites the left has, all while laughing at those insecurities and their reaction to it all.

They were posting it up left and right and when it was found out that the people behind this were just con artists the media instead of correcting themselves just went silent and pretended it never happened or if they did correct themselves it was just one or two articles and that's it.This behaviour is constant and they are largely responsible for the state of things in the west today. They do zero fact checking and as long as it will get them clicks they'll post it up especially if it happens to be something like this where they can peddle their worldview and make it out that anybody who is disagreeing with what this woman did is an evil evil misogynist and the patriarchy is real.,1

"I don't share your positive outlook. However, I do think that the comparison to the evolution of art in the past two centuries is being mimicked by now, we find ourselves in the era of gaming, where some people are trying to figure out new ways to approach videogame development and playability, but generally speaking most participants are either cynical actors or snotty elitists that think their shit don't stink. And just like with art, we are now seeing the kindling embers of the post movement, with games such as Doom, BoTW, Mario Odyssey, RE7, SoulCalibur VI (and a few others), where the cynicism and corporate bullshit is worn-out, and the people involved just want to make games that core audiences have been begging for years, just updated to modern sensibilities and tech specs.I'm sure you're now asking ""But isn't that good? We're getting rid of the ideologues, right?"", to which I say no, not really. See, left a stain in the art world that will likely NEVER go away. Audiences, be them philistines or not, got it into their heads that being an artist means being a snooty cuntbag sniffing their own farts and making up excuses for pointless drivel. Critics, and the elitists in the art world, have also collectively agreed to circle-jerk that notion around. How's things going for post-post modernists? Not well, because even if their work is appreciated, even if it finds an audience, people just think of it as ""Oh right, classic-style art"", and don't give it any further thought, leaving new creators to either become another cog, or fall into obscurity.Can this be solved? Well, the PPM in art is still going, under 30 years of existance, give or take, and only a FEW videogames fall into the equivalent state. But videogames are much more than Art, so the mediocrity of AAA shlock and the douchecannoes flooding the market will still present a colossal challenge to anyone that doesn't have the backing of a major studio. I mean, Return of the Obra Dinn is kinda PPM, but it still doesn't much going for it, and doesn't seem to have much replay value.",1

"Even with all the cringey dialog, I kinda loved Life Is Strange. It had an interesting story for an adventure game and the characters grew on me. But man, they're really trying hard not to come across as retard crusaders at this point. Not buying this crap.

"This is fucking retarded and we need to quit pretending it's not just to ""get back at those mean old entitled women"". 17 year olds want to and are perfectly capable of having sex. Male and female. Enough with the petty bullshit.",1
