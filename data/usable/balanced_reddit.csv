People don't lose sympathy for real victims, they gain a more rational standard for assessing who is or isn't a real victim. That standard being applied going forward doesn't ""victimize"" the real sexual assault victims because no one should be believed in the first place, especially when a corollary of that is condemning someone else.",0

In either case there is no net change in advantage, just in the case of women the one receiving the penalizing would be the party and for men the one whose opponent wasnt penalized when they should have been is the party.

I do not know enough details about their situation, but neither does the OP. Furthermore, he is using the wrong channels to report any suspected crime. The only correct manner to address these suspicions are through the end there's only two pieces of proof, one of which is Alinity speaking in a manner that is dubious on the intent in the first place. Especially without the surrounding content of that the clip is easily pulled out of context. The other piece of ""proof"" used by these people consists of a series of tweets from her ex-husband that it was him who pulled the plug. We have no further proof other than these two things and that by itself isn't enough to warrant a public post and petition to get someone removed from a country.In fact, the more I think about it, the more it feels as if OP was denied something by Alinity and now tries to enact vengeance on her through shoddy defamation.

Almost anybody you said the word to would punch your lights out for saying it. The dictionary did its job - it recorded that English speakers use (or used) this word, and it recorded that it upsets English speakers so much that they won't tolerate use of the word. Dictionaries don't make value judgements, but **you should**.By all means, out-pedant me about emphasisers vs intensifiers. But also note that and ""incredibly"" are also intensifiers, and their original meanings are ""in the realm of fantasy"" and ""lacking credibility"". Your examples don't show that words meaning ""in truth"" should go on to become intensifiers, because words meaning the opposite have also gone on to become intensifiers. There's no moral, logical or etymological reason to let ""literally's"" ""not literally"" meaning stand, and the more you fight it, the more you can reduce its adoption, and with luck it will drop out of usage.",0

"Some info:Abusing a public official (cops are included in this) verbally or physically is a punishable offense in Holland. She did both.

"That was decided in 1973, with language that had no definition as to what an obscenity actually is, how one actually determines what is an obscenity, and what any of the terms involved are.You might as well argue that the Supreme Court upheld slavery at one point, which it did, so why argue against slavery?As I said, the Supreme Court has attempted to punt at every opportunity on deciding the actual use of Miller or exact definition of obscenity. In the age of porn on demand, and expanding protections for non-political free speech in America, one good criminal prosecution that doesn't end in a plea deal could see an appeal go to the SC.And morals are not the basis of the Constitution. That's a conservative fantasy. Rights are not based on morals. They're granted by the virtue of existing. Free speech doesn't exist because your sky wizard commands it. It's a right derived from the need of the individual, and it doesn't require the agreement of the state or of others. The Constitution guarantees individual rights, not group rights, because those rights exist naturally for the individual. Obscenity is the very definition of a group punishment upon the individual, the offense of others as a reason to inflict tyranny on the conservatives make me sick sometimes. The willingness of such types to lock someone up for making drawings or writing novels, to deprive them of liberty because their sky god's jimmies are rustled, as interpreted by priests and their captive that would lock up another human being for scribbles on paper should never speak of standing for anything resembling human dignity.

"With German too. Now, you always need to mention both genders. Example: “Teachers are important.“ We used to always just say “Lehrer sind wichtig“, Lehrer being the word for male teachers.

Now, you need to say “Lehrerinnen und Lehrer sind wichtig“, so actually mentioning both. Or you could also use the Binnen-I (which I personally find terrible) and say LehrerInnen. It’s just stupid. If I was a teacher and someone asked what I worked as, I would answer with teacher. Because who the fuck cares whether I’m a female teacher or a male one, not even mentioning the fact that they can see I’m female anyways. It’s easier and faster to just say the shorter version.

Ask yourself: **Who wants to see that?** For example, Vox Day is trying to capitalize on Comicsgate by creating more right-wing comics, or comics with right wing themes. Personally, I don't want to read his comics; **I don't want right wing comics. I don't want left wing comics.** I don't want to read comics where creators push their politics into it. All I want is what I grew up reading; apolitical, fun stories. By the way, when I say apolitical, I mean I don't want to read characters that are a mouth for political views and/or shilling. It's even worse when the writing is terrible. There are tons of female characters that I love in comics (i.e. Motoko Kusangi from Ghost in the Shell, Kitty Pryde and Rogue from the X-men, Lois Lane from Superman, Mikasa Ackermann from Attack on Titan, Huntress from Birds of Prey, Raven from Teen Titans). You know why I like these characters? Because they're awesome! The writers who write their stories do a good job, because they're good writers and are qualified. I can relate to some of them, and I enjoy watching them overcome their hardships. Now, as far as race goes, at no point did I say I wanted an all white cast of characters (or creators). Do you think I want Storm (from X-men) to be white? I would be pretty annoyed if they did something that stupid, since her African ancestry has been an important part to her character (If you've read Life Death for example). But here's the double standard; remember when Scarlett Johansson was cast as the Major for the live action Ghost in the Shell? Remember how angry people were, claiming that the Major is Japanese. They were talking about whitewashing! Now, if that's the case, then why does nobody complain when white characters are changed (i.e. Jimmy Olsen in the Supergirl TV series, Perry White in Man of Steel, Mercy Graves in Dawn of Justice, Johnny Storm in the Fantastic Four movie, etc) in the mainstream? Granted, these aren't the comics, but the principle is the same. I'll tell you why this is happening: *First of all, it's a blatant double standard.* Second, the people who do this claim that the race of the characters that they change is unimportant, and yet when the race of characters (who's race was unimportant in their own stories) are played by whites, they call it racist and yet, when ACTUAL fans point out the (because they **actually read/buy the comics**), they are painted as racists by the mainstream media, or as crybabies.So this tells me that the race swapping is a politically motivated move; they claim that ""people of color"" are This is all based on the politically motivated belief that white people are privileged, and that minorities are being ""forced out"". In other words, this boils down to the belief that ""whites are bad"", or that ""minorities are being And the annoying thing about it is that the creators of these comics/shows sometimes go out of their way to vilify anyone who points this out.This is why certain legacy characters at Marvel are being overshadowed by minority counterparts (Miles Morales, Riri Williams, the Asian Hulk guy, the female replacement of Thor and Wolverine, etc). If you actually read the articles I posted, you'd see why these characters were created in the first place. Part of it was to boost sales, but in the long run, these characters have no depth, because what's being sold to us are FEMALE and NON-WHITE characters, not HEROES. Who wants to read characters defined by gender and skin color? That's why the Alt-Right is annoying; nobody enjoys a character who's being sold for what they are. We like characters for WHO they are, not WHAT they are. And before you say I contradicted myself, remember that the race/gender swapping is a one way straight; the creators are doing this only change characters. And to make it worse, they openly insult this demographic for not liking the comics. What better way to sell comics than to insult a huge part of your reader base.Besides, why do you think many fans hate the new Star Wars films? They brought back the original characters, and then killed of Han Solo and Luke Skywalker. WHY? That's stupid!People who grew up with these comics are attached to the legacy characters (Steve Rogers, Tony Stark, Bruce Banner, Peter Parker, etc). They put these characters in the movies, but the idea of making movies based on comics is to sell the comics. So when you buy the comics after seeing the film, and then the characters you watched are overshadowed in the comics by their sjw counterparts, or completely replaced in the comics by them. That's what we call a This doesn't even make sense in an economic sense.I don't like Jessica Cruz because she's a coward who - in the beginning - was in a holding pattern of being an insecure coward, with little character development (until Dan Jurgens fixed that when he took over writing Green Lanterns; he actually created character development for the two stars, and made them enjoyable for once). It has nothing to do with her being female or Hispanic. What's happening in the modern comic industry is that characters aren't being treated as equals. They are instead being placed on a pedestal solely for their biological traits. In other words, giving characters special treatment and shoved into the foreground solely because of how they were ""born"". So, equality - if that was what was intended - isn't even being achieved in this form. The creators being hired to write characters that are the same race, gender, or sexuality as themselves in stupid. Just because you're gay, doesn't mean you can write good gay characters. In fact, it doesn't even mean that you're a good writer at all. Being a good writer should be the sole requirement for writing a character.I could go on forever, but here's my overall point: I don't want a comic book that look like Agent Smith's Matrix. I want good writing, good characters that are interesting to read, creators that are qualified as and characters are aren't a political for hard left creators. I just want apolitical (in other words, no propaganda) fun stories, like what I used to read when I was younger. I like super hero comics. I don't like SJWism. I don't like being preached at by hard left liberals (or alt-right people, for that matter).",0

"> The media portrays Trump to be an idiot at every opportunity they canBy reporting what he says and does? Sure, CNN is biased toward their corporate -- NOT progressive -- agenda and some criticism of Trump is unfounded. But Trump makes himself look like an idiot most of the time. He doesn't understand issues or process or the constitution he swore to protect. Remember when he wanted to take individuals' guns away without due process? Remember when he said tariffs are good because the exporting country pays them, when importers and US consumers actually pay tariffs? Plus, he constantly contradicts himself -- even in the same sentence -- without any help from the media. Trump: > In my plan, (taxes on the rich are) going down, but by the time it's negotiated, they'll go up.He sure knows how to con people, though, which is what he's been doing for decades. Technically Trump lost money on all his scams, because he'd have made more money investing his inheritance in the market. Like everything else about him, Trump's business success is a ruse. So he's not that smart, is he? > The media brainwashes people into getting all riled up about politics so that we hate our is exactly what Trump does when he blames everything on Democrats, no matter how outlandish. Death toll in PR: Democrats. Migrant caravan: Democrats. Mail bombs: Democrats. Legislative gridlock while Republicans hold both houses: Democrats. He sicks his crowds on journalists at every rally, even as one of his followers is sending bombs out. He offers to pay the legal bills for followers who assault protesters. He celebrates a Republican candidate for assaulting a journalist. Trump is the epitome of the mentality. It's never his fault -- always someone else's. Crucially, violence against his opponents is OK, but criticism of him is not. If you say nice things about Trump, then no matter what else you do, you're a good guy. But if you oppose him whatsoever, then you're an enemy. It's not about principle; it's about personal loyalty. That's far closer to how the Nazis operated than anything CNN does.As for economic conditions, real wage growth is virtually nonexistent, but all of the positive trends started under Obama, so the only thing Trump can say is that he hasn't fucked it up yet. Except, his one major economic policy, tariffs, are doing much more to hurt the economy than help. And his only major legislative is a massive tax break for the rich that will bankrupt the US just like he's bankrupted so many of his own companies -- including a fucking casino! -- not to mention all the small contractors he never paid. I notice you don't cite the stock market rally, which Trump constantly took credit for, because all the gains from this year were just wiped out, but Trump isn't taking credit for that, is he?Recently, Trump claimed he was going to pass a tax break for families -- which somehow he forgot in the bill he actually signed -- before yesterday's election. Except congress wasn't sitting again before the election. So, not only is he benefiting the rich and powerful at the expense of the poor and middle class, but either he doesn't know how laws are made or he's betting that his followers don't know either. Even if CNN does lie and manipulate their audience, Trump is doing the exact same or worse. When he calls ANY media criticism of himself ""fake news"" and calls those who report on his lies and misconduct ""enemy of the people,"" he's literally channeling Stalin. And some are lapping it up like warm milk. The only reason Trump's support is as high as it is is because his followers are also living in echo chambers, like Fox News (propaganda arm of the GOP), where any criticism is labeled ""fake"" regardless of merit and lies are repeated ad nauseam. But don't fool yourself, Trump lost the popular vote even with all the Republican insecure voting machines, and voter suppression. Now, the three swing states he needed to win the electoral college just elected Democratic governors. When the House starts doing its job and Trump's misconduct, things are going to get a lot darker for Trump and Co.",0

Hell, I'm pretty sure most Glaswegians and Londoners aren't even speaking the same *language* (and no, for all it may sound like it neither are speaking Scots or Gaelic), but they've both probably got more right to claim they're the ones speaking ""proper English"" than anyone in North America. And yes, it is kind of a race thing, because we're largely talking about natural evolutions of the language (some of which I think are thoroughly stupid, sure, but I also feel the same way about a good half of the Top-40 list nowadays so what the hell...) the of which probably has as much to do with race as any concern for how ""ignorant"" they are. Languages change, and just like most changes social and economic influence plays a role.Thing is, those two paragraphs up above would be at best 'informal' nowadays, but I can personally guarantee there're more than a couple things in them that'd have rightly or wrongly been considered improper English just a couple decades ago. (Might've even gotten me called things like 'dumb' and 'ignorant,' too!)In the end, though, all those 'improper' English constructs can nice to have around, because just like our mishmash of a vocabulary in which you have a goose, moose, and mongoose (yet two geese, meese, and that's not right at all) and knowing how to pronounce something often depends on recognizing which language we stole it from in the first place, they offer us a delightful palette of tone and to play with.

Nazis do not give a fuck about freedom of speech, they just know that you do give a fuck. They actively want to remove freedom of speech and freedom of movement and freedom of association and freedom of being alive from people simply for being born not white. It’s naive to think that the free marketplace of ideas can defeat these people, because they aren’t actually in the They’re gaming the marketplace to co-opt it and destroy it. And people are too stupid to notice it happening. It’s obvious that the marketplace of ideas has failed as the violence we see at protests now is a symptom of that failure. I believe that there are ideas that can undermine the entire structure of our country and we must do everything we can to protect ourselves from these ideas. If you think America cannot be defeated by an idea, then you need to understand that America as founded on ideas and defeated Britain with those ideas. The war with radical Islamic terrorists is going to be won with an idea. Fuck man, it’s arguable that the idea of America and the H-bomb is what has kept the world in relative peace since WW2.

"I surely believe it's more needed there, but that doesnt mean that there arent quirks left that needs fine tuning in the west. Take the wage gap for instance. First of all, the whole 77% of what a man makes is across jobs, not for the same jobs, so it doesnt necessarily prove that women are treated unfairly. But it does highlight some values that still linger that that limits peoples choices through norms if not by rules. You could perhaps say that reducing the wage gap is a mens issue. Cause why do we have such a gap? We put a lot of on women, but being able to earn a lot is not what we expect, so they might feel more free to pursue their passions even if it doesnt provide as much revenue, and take a workload that suits them better. Men on the other hand are considered more imporant, and are seen as more attractive, if they have money and power. So men put passions and personal well-being aside because we have to make money. Another thing that is important to remember is that we cant expect things to stay the way they are, even here in the west. Right wingers dont want women to have access to abortions or for kids to get sexual makes the girls end up pregnant) and thinks marital rape is okay. And the alt right movement has been growing a lot the last few years and is still growing. Racists and bigots are always at work, and financial interests in politics will always need a social struggle that they can use to trojan in their own politics, so the extremists on both sides will always get funding. They're pitting them up against each other, trying to create polarized enemies, and in my oppinion you're falling for that tactic.

"Im just hung up on the beating being warranted in any way, shape or form. It doesn’t the situation at all. Its senseless the means with which the police have to apprehend people. And, if its not senseless then its The cop could tackle the lady, the other cops would swarm her, over power her, and have her in a squad car before the video is even over. But fine. Maybe its a cultural like you said. You always side with police no matter what, and I always side with not beating people for not much of a reason other than to hit back for the sake of hitting back. Just because someone hits you, it doesn’t mean you hit them back. Is it within the cops right? Again, that doesn’t mean he should do it. Look at the size of the cop compared to her. She is treated like a rag-doll when he handled her. Instead of doing all of that, making a huge fuss, causing people to run, the cop could have capped it and ended it there by tackling her to the ground, and cuffing her. And look, the woman is completely at fault. She deserves her punishment in a court— or however you do it in holland. She deserves her time, and that, I believe, is justice. The root of that fuss is obviously coming from her, she is the biggest factor in the fuss. The thing is, the cops contribute to the fuss. If it was up to me, that would not be an officer’s purpose. You try your best not to contribute violence in a situation when you don’t need to and the officer really did need to at all. If you think he did, I still need you to rationally explain how a drunk lady can do more than a black eye on a cop. If she had a weapon, you would think she would have drawn it after a punch or two. But she didn’t, so maybe at that point you stop punching her and just cuff her. Then again, maybe not. You guys handle your women however you want, I guess. I won’t tell you what to, and what not to do with them. The base of my argument is that I just believe the police can, and should do better than that. They shouldn’t have to beat people in order to get them to comply. Its not their job to injure criminals, its their job to apprehend them. The only times I feel it IS warranted is life or death riots, or a raid. But, presumably you raid with guns, so I don’t know why there would be a beating involved. But I digress. Finally, I guess I’ll apologize. I get a little emotional when I get in a debate. Maybe it really is just cause we’re from different parts of the world.",0

"Briar Beauty disobeys the fairies. She’s separated from her parents as a baby for her safety, doesn’t even know them.*Beauty and the Beast* is one that you absolutely need to see, the animated version is one of Disney’s greatest movies, if not the single best. It was the first animated film ever nominated for Best Picture at the Academy Awards, quite deservedly so (but it lost quite fairly to *The Silence of the Lambs* -- nothing had a chance with that kind of competition) and very noticeably contributed to the creation of the Best Animated Picture category. The recent live-action adaptation is watchable by the strength of its source material but it's very bloated, partially because of the completely unnecessary effort to establish Belle as having some kind of engineering skill (when she's already a standout by virtue of being an imaginative bookworm in a provincial village) and establish the villain's shitty little sidekick as gay (which was *horrendous*, he's like a walking minstrel show, and his switch to being a good guy in the middle of the third act is plainly forced and nonsensical to the point that the movie *even makes a joke about it*).Belle *definitely* has a father here, in fact his fuckup kicks off the plot — Belle goes out looking for her father after he foolishly takes a wrong turn on the road and wanders into the Beast’s castle, where he is taken prisoner by the Beast (her father’s horse returns without him and then takes Belle back). Belle, against her father’s wishes, offers to be the Beast’s prisoner in her father’s place, and her father returns to town raving about it all hoping to rally help to free her. Everyone assumes her father is crazy, so Belle and the Beast have time for most of the rest of the movie to is extremely and deliberately archetypal, it’s absolutely packed with stuff from Carl Jung.

Their EARNINGS are not. they are not conflatable you fucking moron. They mean two completely different things. Earnings constitutes variable such as longer hrs, overtime, bonuses, awards, etc. men work more than women. men choose higher paying careers. women gravitate to jobs that dont pay shit. when all the human variables such as free will and choice are accounted for, the gap DISSAPEARS. in other words, youre a highly unusable, worthless peice of data so you can push an anti woman narrative. at least answer me this if you dont address anything ive said:if women got paid less than men, why arent men out of their jobs, being replaced by women? why are men hired at all? its simple business, you pay only as much as worth, and by your bullshit claim, women are only worth 75 percent of men. thats a lot of money these businesses could be saving. answer me that retard.",0

The crazy thing is not what Adolf wants, but the way he starts out to get it.

And yes that manifested as believing that blacks, being the most different from Anglo Saxon whites, where in fact inferior, but as any one who has studied the man & his works can see that was the result of his pathological xenophobia. and it's a good thing he was, if he wasn't we wouldn't have got any of his stand out work, since his work, which is predicated on the fear of the other, simply would not exist without it. People who just declare that Lovecraft was racist & leave it at that miss the point. His hatred wasn't about skin colour, it was about other-ness, which he described as being inhuman & that's how he describes anyone that wasn't a white anglo saxon of british stock.At least in theory, since he then went on toe marry a Jewish woman.

"It's a shame that argument works for people. If I were raped, I would not be afraid of there being evidence of me lying about it. At worst, I couldn't prove it happened and that's it. So they get ""away"" with it.That's just a reality of rape cases. But it's very, very, very unlikely that you'd ever find yourself actually raped and then have tons of evidence that could prove (at a criminal level) that you made it up entirely, to the point you can be a more but still not great argument of ""but that will make liars never come forward!"" Meaning, innocent men who have been in prison for years and are only freed after a woman comes clean about having lied about it and feels guilty... would remain in prison for the full sentence. And never have their innocence known (not that it helps that much anyway; your life is still ruined, you can't get that time back and the sentence will still follow you are few exceptions where it's that they lie, there was a woman who was raped by a man as a girl, and that man threatened to kill her and her family if she pinned it on him. I forget the specifics, but she blamed another man (I believe the actual rapist was part of why she accused him). And the innocent man was found guilty. And many, many years later she finally comes clean about the situation. So the innocent man was freed. You can understand why a young girl would lie when her actual rapist is threatening her life. It's still horrible that an innocent man's life was ruined forever. But would she come forward if she would be thrown in prison for lying? Should she be?That's a valid argument to start having. But the whole ""oh well they'll prove you're lying"" as a victim is just a silly argument.I think the most reasonable solution to the problem I mentioned is to basically give a clean slate for any people who have lied and gotten men put in prison. So they can come forward without punishment. But, moving forward, it's actually enforced if you're proven to be lying. Since I do think if women came forward about lying, and they were thrown in prison for it... they wouldn't come forward at all. But we can't just let this continue how it is either. Relying on guilt after sometimes *decades* to finally get some honesty going. There was one guy who was convicted and his mother died while he was locked away. And the woman had lied about it, and when he was freed he was torn up because his mother died thinking that he was a rapist. It's just awful. Nobody said rape cases were simple though. They're the most difficult things to deal with. Which is why it's always full of so many problems.",0

">If the contemporary right is becoming more liberal, that doesn't mean the contemporary right is changing - it means more people are accepting of liberal values (which the right has traditionally not been). And I fully agree.That's a contradictory statement. If the people on the contemporary right are becoming more accepting of liberal values, that means the contemporary right is changing. By I honestly think you are trying to paint a picture of a new, improved, updated right-wing - accepting of gays, accepting of personal freedoms when it comes to issues such as abortion etc... which at best, is simply a thinly veneered attempt to attract ""new blood"" by throwing out some of the ideas that simply aren't going to wash in the modern world (eg - Milo being ""flamboyantly gay"" - while at the same time taking an anti-gay stance on just about every gay rights issue - such as gay marriage which, even though he has indulged in it himself, he claims should be ""called something else"".)First off, Milo *changed his stance* on the gay marriage issue when he fell in love and got married. He's recently said he thinks the only reason people would deny same-sex couples the right to a civil marriage is pure cruelty. He changed his former stance and admitted it.Obama evolved. So did Milo.Not to mention, opposition to gay marriage *used to be prevalent on the radical left*. Indeed, the radical queer left used to see gay marriage as attempted cultural assimilation, and as the introduction of patriarchal and heteronormative institutions into queer culture. Indeed, it was the work of *gay conservatives and moderates* like Andrew Sullivan and Bruce Bawer that first popularized the idea of gay marriage (read *A Place At The Table* and *Virtually Normal*). Why does the radical left get a pass, with their arguments *not* besmirching or invalidating the left, but Bawer and Sullivan somehow indicate nothing at all about changing perspectives on the right?Finally, your entire argument so far has *systematically ignored the existence of ideological libertarians*. After all, they complicate the simplistic Manichean narrative of ""if you support abortion rights and same-sex marriage rights you must undyingly support the Democrats because All Republicans Are Evil"" you're trying to weave. >You have to admit, the so-called new, ""liberal"" right wing which you are trying to convince me exists, and the old fashioned Bible-thumping, cross-burning right-wing have an awful lot in common - Love of Trump,Trump is the most socially liberal Republican candidate in decades, a thrice-married foul-mouthed philanderer who has publically questioned aspects of the war on drugs and interventionist foreign policy, and who triangulated *to the left* on issues of international economics to capture a constituency (the Rust Belt working class) and thus win the extremist right wing, huh? In addition, his immigration policy works out to labor protectionism and both Sanders and Hillary wanted more border enforcement too. >hatred of feminism, Equivocation. Feminism isn't a monolith. You can hate contemporary feminism whilst accepting the idea that women should be able to get jobs or live as career-women should they choose. Not to mention there are multiple reasons to dislike contemporary feminism, not all of which are I'm against contemporary feminism *because it isn't enough*. >hatred of Islam, George W Bush was frequently at pains to emphasize he wasn't at war with Islam, only Terrorism, and that he regarded Islam as a ""religion of peace."" Not to mention the New Atheist movement was dominated by liberals and leftists yet was quite critical of many aspects of Islam. >rejection of #metoo, Belief in due process and the presumption of innocence is a right-wing position now? Not to mention, #MeToo was started in response to allegations about the sexual misconduct of Harvey Weinstein, and a *huge number of conservatives gleefully celebrated the downfall of a huge Hillary donor*. >belief in traditional gender roles, On this you're mostly right, however by the same token people on the left consistently accuse Men's Human Rights Activists and MGTOWs of being ""right-wing"". Yet both the MHRM and MGTOW are founded on a *rejection* of traditional masculine gender roles. The actual alt-right are I concede to engage in conspiracy theories (Pizza Gate, Sandy Hook being a false flag)Yes, and the left *never* believes in conspiracy theories at all! Oh what fucking rot. Nancy MacLean's *Democracy In Chains* is a left-wing conspiracy theory promoted by a Duke University historian for fuck's sake. Not to mention a lot of the anti-Zionist left is prone to embracing certain unsavory conspiracy theories about ""the Jews."">and, as we're discussing this on a Gamergate subreddit, hatred of Anita Sarkeesian/Zoe Quinn.Yes, personal animosity towards *two particular people* somehow counts as a meaningful and deep political issue that defines the essential characteristics of an ideology. Note the sarcasm.>And if we include Breitbart (who certainly would include themselves, and I don't really think you can exclude them simply because they don't fit your idea of what constitutes the ""new right""), then we can include white nationalism in the mix, too. Guilt by association. Anyone can comment on Breitbart. Not to mention, the editorial line and positions of *Breitbart* are determined by Breitbart's *authors* rather than *readers*. >I could easily have cited Andrew Anglin or Richard Spencer - outright white yes, Andrew Anglin... the guy who declared Holy War against Milo Yiannopoulos. the ideology that rejects civic nationalism as cuckery, and liberal individualism as a Jewish please let me know how support for a classically liberal civic nationalism built on individualism and the values of the Enlightenment *somehow equates to supporting the alt-right... a movement that rejects enlightenment individualism, civic nationalism and classical liberalism*. >You may say they are different, but they are unequivocally the same in many ways.By the same reasoning I could say that Progressivism is unequivocally the same as Nazism. Pretty much every feature you cite as evidence that people like (for example) Paul Joseph Watson are no different to KKK members is an ideological inessential that has nothing to do with the actual content of a political philosophy.>So it's really just a PR exercise.Just like your posts. You still are in denial that the boundaries of the culture wars have radically shifted. You're still trying to demand that undying support for every excess of the contemporary left be the price of accepting social liberalism. You still seem to think fundamentalist Christians are waiting in the wings even though their influence and numbers are in drastic decline. You still seem to think that the Donkey Party is the party of civil liberties and cultural permissiveness, even though they're using hyperoffended feminists as an army of censorious church ladies and as advocates against due process. By no means would I suggest that anyone who is a ""true"" social liberal should vote straight Republican. There are Democrats who have preserved a devotion to civil liberties and cultural liberalism.

In many of these cases the person complaining is expecting something extra. I'm guessing the theater offered vouchers or something and she wanted more. Now a refund would have been an expected option. Maybe she wanted her food refunded or something. Usually there is more to these stories and we don't have both sides. Generally this might have not been the case here) someone has to be a royal asshole or nut job to get a company to respond like that. When I was in retail years ago we dealt with some really crazy assholes. What sucks is that management usually caved in which just encouraged people to be bigger assholes.,0

"That is wrong.Look at Virginia caseThe 2005 case involves Dwight Whorley, who downloaded both real CP (14 pictures) and loli/shota (20 pictures) to a computer. was the first person convicted for loli/shota under the PROTECT act, but that wasn't what he was solely convicted for. He was also a repeat offender with regards to real CP. He tried to appeal the conviction under the PROTECT act all the way to the Supreme Court, but the Supreme Court refused to hear his case.>2008 Iowa caseThe last case where someone was convicted solely of loli/shota was the 2008 Christopher Handley case. *A U.S. district court ruled the relevant parts of the PROTECT act were but still hit Handley with an obscenity charge. The Comic Book Legal Defense Fund (CBLDF) was defending Handley, but he was worried a jury might not acquit, and he faced a maximum 15-year sentence. So he took a plea bargain for 6 months, and the case never went to Supreme Court.>2010 Idaho caseThe guy had real CP in addition to loli/shota, and took a plea deal for 15 months. He admitted that he had knowingly received real CP for at least eight years. Maine caseThe guy had real CP in addition to loli/shota. He was charged for both, but the loli/shota charges were later dropped at both the state and federal level.>2012 Missouri caseThe guy had real CP in addition to loli/shota, and took a plea deal. Part of the negotiations of that deal were that the real CP charges be dropped, and that he be charged solely for Michigan casesTwo inmates in prison, one was caught producing 10 hand-drawn images and 16 written stories, the other caught possessing some of those stories. Both were already in prison for sexual abuse and assault of real children. Both accepted plea deals, the first got 7 years added to his sentence, the second had 2 years added. The first inmate went later to appeals court, and the appeals court upheld the state conviction. The inmate didn't try appealing to the Supreme Court. TL;DR: Stick to 2D, and you won't have any legal issues. In the absolute worst case you'll be hit with an obscenity charge, but even if you are, you can contact the Comic Book Legal Defense Fund and they will defend you for free.",0

And since social media receives special protections as a supposedly ""neutral"" platform while clearly violating the precepts of that special status and both google and faceberg are benefactors of government contracts and investment, these companies ALREADY fall under the purview of the US government to there is nothing stopping fools from ceasing to patronize these insufferable centralized platforms and moving to the many alternatives that already exist. Centralized platforms are a disease and the abuse of their temporary power is also the cure. They are merrily digging their own graves and should not be interrupted.",0

"I play GTAO and recently just argued this with a friend. If you have a desire to just buy shark cards, then you don't actually have a desire to play the game. Over the past few months, simply logging into the game has netted me millions of GTA bucks. They have double cash promos all the time and they have giveaways all the time that simply hand you money.Now, if you wanted to invest time into the game and actually play it then you should have enough money by the end of doing everything to buy almost everything in the game. All the DLC is end game content. It's like buying an expansion pack with virtual currency. And once you have the CEO expansion with a garage (probably $2mil you can do car heists to make money. This alone makes buying shark cards for someone who doesn't have time anymore super easy. In 15 min, you can quickly make and more if you collect a set of cars.Shark cards are for two people: people who want to play that don't have time but want a fancy car to run with their friends OR people who think because a new car is out, they must buy it like some autistic gamer.All the things you buy in the game for the necessity to have fun are cheap. If you need the fancy stuff, play the game as intended or spend you money.Back in subject though: Cheating should never get you any time in jail. And what stops in-game exploits from being considered cheating later if this doesn't get a nail in the coffin?",0

"nobody can ever put pressure on the SQLite team, in any form whatsoever. outside of Hipp himself waking up one day and deciding ""hey now we're woke af fam"", basically nothing can make them budge. the consulting company selling support is himself & partners, the code is public domain but not open t o and they're very very much financially independent thanks to the two billions plus device the software is deployed on.however, using the occasion be a cheeky cunt, while i didn't peg the character as it, it wouldn't surprise me that much. woke tech twitter has been fuming over that, which gotta give a hearty chuckle to anybody that can look at them from the position hwaci is.edit: for a more concrete answer : SQLite being public domains means nobody asks for shit from the SQLite team, there's zero string attached, even less than the GPL license , or even less than the BSD license. there's zero reason for a corporation using SQLite to pressure the team, because they can keep mooching out of the excellent work of the team without ever paying a dime if they don't feel inclined to.full disclosure: a lot feel inclined to because SQLite professional support is laughably cheap, and you get access to answers from people that actually know what the fuck they're talking about. and when you're dealing with hundred million dollars business, you ain't fucking up your pasty few thousands dollars contract over twitter bullcrap. the adults are in the room if you're using SQLite and are in a position to bully manglement into buying at least a perpetual license, please do.

"is certainly always subjective, but in common morality I think family members would be upset and find it unacceptable for people who didn't know the deceased to come and kiss them, or to be admitted to their wake at all.Prince Charming being a character and not a person is not relevant to the ideas being depicted in the story, and there would be a difference in weighing the relationship of a man and woman if comparing a woman inviting a man to sing vs a man interrupting a woman to obtain imaginary consent the same way people would, just as characters can ""die"" or ""eat"" or ""lift a log"" even though they don't literally do those things since they are not real. I'm not really sure what you're getting upset about ""beloved"", there is a difference between mutual love and one-sided love, and based solely on the dialogue of the Disney movie, I'm not sure we can say that Snow requited his feelings, though there were certainly hints about it.I'm not sure what you mean by Reviewing the scene at he arrives on horse and begins singing and walks down and the traumatized dwarfs pretty much stand there in shock as he walks by them. While they do clear a path by backing up, this is because he was already in the process of making for her.Factors we should weigh here are (1) he's at least double their height, meaning 8x their weight (2) he's armed with a sword (3) he's clearly a member of the nobility, not to be trifled with. (4) he's young and athletic. How could we expect these halfling elderly obese unarmed gentile subhumans who are in mourning to put up any kind of immediate defense in this situation? They could be paralyzed with fear, or too shocked by his actions to actually process what is happening until he does it.>So, the, ever, loving, fuck, what? It is a story telling NARRATIVE device. You are projecting your insane worldview onto a CHILDREN'S STORY.I'm not sure what aspect of my world view you are calling insane. As far as projecting our world views into stories to interpret them, we all do if we try to imagine the prince with thoughts and personality instead of a THING, it does bring up complex questions which do not occur to us when merely processing him as a plot device when initially watching this as a trauma you had in your life ... it is YOUR trauma for YOU to deal with. Insisting that the rest of us adhere to your neurotic worldview is both delusional and really not interested in dwelling upon your tendency to personally insult people. I'm simply saying that based upon what we see, there is not visible grounds to say that the prince had consent for what he did.There could have been off-camera occurances (these are implied or possible in films all the time) which could have made it acceptabl. We may not have seen all the interactions that PC/SW had, they might have already kissed / fucked / secretly married, she may have told the Dwarves about the prince, etc.There's no PROOF that this is sexual assault / necrophilia, merely the possibility exists and can't be ruled out by the film lik might include information lacking in the film which could clear up questions people have on how to interpret some things, I wouldn't be able to tell without reading it.If we go before Disney to it went rather happened, however, that a king's son came into the forest, and went to the dwarfs' house to spend the night. He saw the coffin on the mountain, and the beautiful Snow-white within it, and read what was written upon it in golden letters. Then he said to the dwarfs, ""Let me have the coffin, I will give you whatever you want for it."" But the dwarfs answered, ""We will not part with it for all the gold in the world."" Then he said, ""Let me have it as a gift, for I cannot live without seeing Snow-white. I will honour and prize her as my dearest possession."" As he spoke in this way the good dwarfs took pity upon him, and gave him the coffin.>And now the King's son had it carried away by his servants on their shoulders. And it happened that they stumbled over a tree-stump, and with the shock the poisonous piece of apple which Snow-white had bitten off came out of her throat. And before long she opened her eyes, lifted up the lid of the coffin, sat up, and was once more alive. ""Oh, heavens, where am I?"" she cried. The King's son, full of joy, said, ""You are with me,"" and told her what had happened, and said, ""I love you more than everything in the world; come with me to my father's palace, you shall be my wife."">And Snow-white was willing, and went with him, and their wedding was held with great show and splendour.In the original tale, my objections are absent. The dwarves are asked, give permission, nothing about the king's son being armed, she wakes up due to accidental dislodging of the apple instead of a kiss. There could still be some elements of coercion with the dwarves, but they are much more active participants and guardians in this case.The wording of KS (king's son) is rather commanding (""come with me ... you shall be my wife"") which I'm sure some people would still have a problem with. Snow has a positive reaction (""was willing"") much as she does in the Disney film, but the issue I think some people have is that one cannot assume the reaction will always be positive to things like without consent or commanding people to you, even though there are certainly women who enjoy having that done to them.",0

Funny thing as I understand it even in the early 1900s a lot of women didn't want to be involved in politics in any way even voting, as they wanted to do it correctly and that's a lot of effort to look into those running, or they saw it as all underhanded crooked nastiness and they didn't want any part of it.That's a lot of time and effort that could be used for important things, like oh I don't know **their fucking only ones who seemed to give a shit were barren or rich bitches who basically had poor women raise their children for them(not really the best idea) didn't have to tend house either as they had servants for that too and were bored. That's why normal women didn't really give much of a fuck for feminist bullshit until public schooling both came around and as largely mandatory and they had appliances to take care of most of the house work. Then they got bored.Seems to me that the fucking government should stop trying to take women's jobs from them.",0

It lead to a lot of favoritism in that people the manager liked and wanted overtime would get it offered more, and people they didn't like who wanted overtime would never get it, or if you had things you needed to attend to tough shit you have to stay at work another 4 hours or get wrote up.The main thing I don't like about the union is it seems that some people who are total fuck ups (sleeping on the job, clocking in and leaving and coming back to clock out) seem to take forever to lose their job.

"No, it's really not. Here's what happened (speaking as someone on the left). I think about a decade or so ago, things were by and large much more liberal. People were focused on more individual level diversity, breaking down expectations placed on people, letting people choose their own path in life. That sort of thing. (As an example, universal health care is touted as making it easier for people to open up businesses). But over the last decade or so, things have changed. I think the left has moved away from being liberal, and is now more progressive. And there IS a distinct difference. The former is about freedom and choice and and the latter is about results and statistics and ratios. Now, I don't think that's permanent. I think a big part of that is because (especially something like Critical Theory) plays VERY well in 140 (now 280, but the same idea goes) characters. And a LOT of effort goes into covering up the idea that there's ""two lefts"". Including, I might add, the opposition to GamerGate. Liberalism and are simply not the same thing. They don't go together at all. Now, there might be some but where they're coming from and how to get there tend to be entirely different.",0

The deaths of these soldiers were just numbers to their superiors. A really great way to honor the dead is to make sure these wars dont happen.

">> She didn't admit that she did it on purpose. Yes, she made a comment that is questionable but it's not an admission of guilt whatsoever.> That's just utter bullshit.It isn't. She did make comments that are questionable but each and every single person quoting this conversation doesn't take into account the larger context of that stream. We have a singular statement that, while making fun of the marriage, doesn't implicitly say that she married the guy on purpose. While the rabid mob will not see that the same way, it is important to keep in mind the context of the quote in order to make it admissible in court.But what every single person here seems to forget is that in order to be divorced, they need to justify their reasoning (including her situation that she is from another country) for filing divorce in Canada. So unless you believe that the Canadian system is so shit that she slipped through, she has been going through that in a legal manner and not get deported for it. >> the problem is that it's not an accusation alone. It calls for deportation directly, rather than an which implies that the people posting it consider her guilty without due process.> This is like you saying people shouldn't use the phrase ""break a leg"" as it implies self hurting, which it technically, but you could also stop taking the piss and realize what this is about, she admitted to a crime, we're asking for justice.You are already pinning a guilty state on a person that made a comment and hasn't been charged with anything. You are pushing a narrative that someone **needs** to be deported while she hasn't been tried and convicted for what **YOU** claim she did wrong.She may very well have done wrong and if that is the case then the legal system of Canada will take care of that. It is not up to you or anyone else other than an official judge to call for her deportation or any other form of punishment. That you do not understand this basic legal protection is exactly the problem here. It's not about what she said, it's about how you choose to **forego** legal procedure in favour of vigilante justice through societal slandering and accusations. It doesn't matter who it is to me, it's the process that is being used by you people. It's that you allow this to happen that prompts a response.

">Jesus you are dense. Do tell.> Assuming I think male rape victims are more privileged that women because I claim to be a feminist is absolutely retarded.I didn't. I said feminism has always tried to benefit women before men even when men were worse off. Like male rape and abuse victims. Feminism has bought a lot of attention to female victims while ignoring and sometimes actively silencing efforts to help male victims, who were already screwed over by comparison to women before feminism even existed.If feminism was about equality, it would devote more than a fraction of it's effort to helping male victims. It does not. It regularly genders rape and abuse as ""violence against women"" by men. I've had lots of discussions with feminists, and a lot of them just say it's men's job to get support for themselves. Even though feminism often says *everyone* should support female victims, and women's shelters even get government to some feminists, men aren't really systemically discriminated against when they do report, they're just too sexist to admit they were victimized, like women. The irony never seems to register.> I already emphasized the nuanced difference and you still ram it down that if I use the word feminism I can’t possibly agree that some men have had a hard go.No, I don't.

"I'm sure you'll find at least one of these websites the early 1920s, the use of sunglasses started to become more widespread, especially among movie stars. Inexpensive mass-produced sunglasses made from celluloid were first produced by Sam Foster in 1929. Foster found a ready market on the beaches of Atlantic City, New Jersey, where he began selling sunglasses under the name Foster Grant from a Woolworth on the Boardwalk. By 1938, *Life* magazine wrote of how sunglasses were a ""new fad for wear on city streets ... a favorite affectation of thousands of women all over the U.S."" It stated that 20 million sunglasses were sold in the United States in 1937, but estimated that only about 25% of American wearers needed them to protect their eyes.[Zenni Optical]( wasn’t until the mid 20th century when sunnies really started to be used as we they are today. This is mainly thanks to Sam Foster, founder of Foster Grants, and Hollywood. In 1929, Foster sold inexpensive, mass-produced frames made specifically to protect people’s eyes from the sun on the beaches of the Atlantic City Boardwalk. Around this time, sunglasses were also beginning to be used widely among actresses, to hide from the paparazzi, and to cover their red eyes brought on from the powerful arc lamps needed for the low speed film FASHION]( the start of the century, they were a favorite accessory among movie stars. For actresses, they served two practical purposes. First, glasses helped celebrities disguise themselves from fans. Additionally, the lights used back then on film sets and in cameras were extremely powerful and harsh- flashbulbs even contained magnesium. Paparazzi flash was literally blinding, and often caused actresses to frequently suffer from red, watery eyes. To avoid being photographed or having to greet fans in this state, dark glasses were essential. Tinted lenses helped to alleviate and hide the these glasses were initially worn for practical purposes, the fact that they were worn by glamorous actresses gave them a celebrity appeal.

In fact, I'd say that there's something intrinsically hopeful about the series (and the titles) purely from the basic gameplay: players overcoming trials and hardships, vanquishing mighty foes encountered along the way. As for the story, I'd point to the End of Fire ending of DS3, which I'd call the best closure to the series as a whole, being built on the Fire Keeper's hope that mercy-killing the world altogether will eventually give birth to a wholly new one. It's just foolish to call Dark Souls hopeful by pointing to the Age of Dark, its nature being one of the series' most contentious story is a little more pessimistic in that none of the endings put a stop to the turmoil caused by warring Great Ones and their aspiring human servants, but at least the Yharnam Sunrise ending has you personally escaping from it.> So to sum it up.

Because of black privilege through affirmative action laws. Clearly they have an advantage over white people.

"> The link you posted does not reinforce this point, it merely says more people intermarry, but that is easily correlated with a rise in other ethnicities and the trend of whites to become a national minority.How does the rise in other ethnicities explain away the increasing trend of intermarriage as evidence of immigrants' children mingling? We're looking at the effects of increased diversity, so the increase in other ethnicities is a given. The question is whether they stay clustered or mingle.Are you really trying to say that Whites aren't participating in these > The most common racial or ethnic pairing among newlywed intermarried couples is one Hispanic and one white spouse (42%). Next most common are one white and one Asian spouse (15%) and one white and one multiracial spouse (12%).Looks like we're all mingling! Or, is that what really bothers you? > Depends on the immigrants, not all immigrants are weighed equally. This is the part people like you always forget. For example, Jamaican and Haitian immigrants commit way more crime than Dutch and German immigrants. Literally zero people on the Right are claiming all immigrants are the same, but it is statistically more likely for Mexican immigrants to commit crime than Japanese people. Those are numbers you cannot debate, which is likely why you strawman the conservative position.If you think that ethnicity itself drives criminal behaviour, then you're being blatantly racist. Crime rates are driven by inequality, and inequality often breaks along ethnic lines. That's the only reason there is any correlation between crime rates and ethnicity. this widespread confusion fuels policies which see Canadian police forces funded, not based on actual crime rates, but based on the threats posed by minorities. point isn't to judge individuals based on what groups they belong to. It's to build the kinds of communities that produce less crime. Spoiler: those are diverse democracies with lower inequality and socialist policies. > Diversity for the sake of diversity is not a strength. That is retarded. There is absolutely no data to back that up. If you believe so, you will have to explain to us how blacks, jews, and indians have different brains than whites. You'll have to explain how on a genetic level they are different, as well as cultural. To argue for diversity being a strength, you are in fact arguing for racism.Not sure why I would have to explain anything about various brains, especially since I already cited evidence showing that more diverse communities with more immigrants have less crime. Maybe take a few breathes and revisit that PBS link.I'm not saying ""diversity at all costs,"" any more than you're saying ""all immigration is bad."" But generally increased diversity IS good. There is evidence for that. You're just refusing to look at it.",0

"God you’re a fucking pussy if you think this lady posed a threat to six, trained officers. If she isn’t a lethal threat, why does the cop need to repeatedly beat her in her face? YOU don’t KNOW how much damage that can do! She could be retarded for the rest of her life because she made a stupid decision WHILE drunk. Don’t EVER make any stupid decisions while you’re inebriated otherwise you are a hypocrite. Now, I didn’t put words in your mouth, I asked you questions. Feel free to try to actually answer them next time before trying to read me like a book and make assumptions about me (ironic, huh?) You’re ONLY thinking about the safety of the cops here while also saying that violence against cops almost never happen there. Jesus christ, have some humanity dude. This lady posed literally no threat to 6 trained officers— oh boohoo the cop got a bruise on his arm. This lady could be a vegetable for the rest of her life after the blows that cop delivered to her face and you’re totally fine with it— you even support it. Now, if this was a link to an article saying “woman sentenced to ‘x’ years for assaulting officers” I would be right there with you— it isn’t. Instead, its a cop using an excessive amount of force to apprehend one, singular drunk lady while 5 of his stand within striking distance of both of them. And you’re all cheerin it on. You all just watched a women get the snot beat out of her because she took some drunken swats at an officer. If this lady posed a legitimate threat, then I would also be with you— she clearly doesn’t. She gets tossed around like a rag doll all throughout the video. You guys keep talking about the “potential” threat she posed, how about we talk about the ACTUAL threat she posed which, according to the vide evidence, was slim to none. The officer got a few scratches. Boo fuckin’ hoo. Here’s a band-aid. It may be legal, but that doesn’t mean its right. The lady engaged in the violence, and the cop was sure to retaliate with thrice the amount of pain and ten times the amount of possible destruction that he could have caused on her and her life. Let me ask you the same question I asked another guy, and please actually respond to this one: what do you do if you see an officer beating your You don’t know why the officer is there, he just is and, boy, is he rocking your loved one. Do you just stand by and shrug your shoulders? What if he kills your because of too much trauma to her brain? What then? Is he officer still in the right?",0

Their lives, what they were before this moment has been forgotten. Ravenous. Hungry. They want one thing from him. Sheldon closes his eyes, clears his mind and relaxes his body. What happens next depends completely on the next few seconds. The time between this and what he mutters next feels like an eternity. Slowly, he opens his eyes. He looks at Leonard, then at Penny, both lying lifeless on the floor. Without a second thought, he says with resounding a split second, the crowd pounces on his ready and waiting body.

"It's a very specific case when an author, presumably a weaker party in a negotiation from the point of law, does not understand the actual value of one's creation and signs away one's rights to said creation for pennies. I could see how this is protection from predatory behaviour of companies that purchase the rights, which definitely happens. You have 2 sides to a negotiation - one is a company with millions at its disposal, another one is an author, not particularly rich usually and hence without access to quality lawers. So the rationale is to give the author an opportunity to benefit from one's work in case one has been pressured into selling it away. If you think that companies actually negotiate fairly, you're severy mistaken. They'll use all the tricks to squeeze every penny out of a deal. Might not be the case here, though, since it'd appear CDPR tried their best to be reasonable and offer compensation which has been declined further, so let's see how it goes.",0

"It's funny even when I, well not personally but still, suggest it's Marxism and philosophies derived from it's basis and outlooks are the issue and not the Ashkenazi Jewish people inherently you still get called an anti-Semite. Which give the distinction wouldn't even be correct now would it? I mean were the Semite peoples of antiquity not Arabs, (maybe Persians?) and *Shepardic* Jews? You know the real Jews written of in the bible not a I think Germanic tribe that adopted the religion for most political cohesion reason IIRC in about 1100 or so during the Crusades because the Christians and Muslims were busy murderating each other?My Uncle(by marriage) is an ordained Rabbi, not sure if he is ethnic European Jewish, kind of looks it but I dunno, he's a decent sort. Anyway getting back off the tangent, what is it say more about them that they think only Jews can be Marxists, and that all Jews are Marxists?If you asked my uncle he would vehemently deny that philosophy, possibly quite angrily, and say that every Jew that not only doesn't practice- but especially takes up Marxism is a disgrace to the race(I am guessing I can't say for sure and possibly I shouldn't put words in his mouth) and would almost certainly call Karl Marx an evil man. He said he looked into the Koran I assume) and was dismayed and said it was nothing but hatefulness and being raised Christian, Baptist if it matters though I haven't gone to church in decades, and if I am still Christian I think I may be a poor one who need to put in more effort, I learned some from my uncle. One because he reads Hebrew, I think he said he was working on the Aramaic but wasn't there yet. But he was Messianic so I assume he follows the new testament as well.Anyone few things I learned.It is **not** Thou shalt not kill. The word is actually *murder* not kill. Which does make sense given the fact blessings and such were given in battle, so I assume it's like a self defense thing. Jesus is a complete and it's Yeshua in Aramaic. Yehoshua in Hebrew, and Joshua or Ioshua if you want to get before the 1600s or so. He says he has no idea where that translation comes from.Jehovah is not only a translation but is an INSULTING term and completely blasphemous thing to call the Almighty. Hell is not the place for eternal torment, and does in fact basically just mean a hole in the earth- basically a grave, so yeah everyone *is* going to hell. What we think of as ""hell"" was always called ""the lake of fire"".Also apparently ""God helps those who help themselves"" at least in words near directly to that is not anywhere in the bible. Found that out last time I saw him.Also he suggests that Kosher proscription against meat and dairy being in the same dish was too broadly applied and that it's okay and the passage was not to ""Boil a kid in it's mother's milk.""

There’s so much evidence suppressed by the WH and they absolutely continue to handcuff the And based on SHEER character, BK was belligerent and very wayward.

No lawyer would ever coach a witness like that. Let alone a judge who knows exactly what to look for.

According to you, and the dutch, two wrongs somehow make a right. It was excessive force. The lady needed to be punished, but not like that. There are 6 cops right there. Try to explain to me how 6 cops can’t apprehend one drunk woman. If they can’t they need better training. Let me ask you: whats the point of the judicial system, according to you? Honestly?

"We women don't constantly fear a man kidnapping us and ass-raping us until we die, and there is no ""good reason"" to do so. That sounds the same as when feminists claim that every time a woman engages in sex she's also incredibly afraid that if she said no the man would rape her. It's a scare tactic used to shame and silence men and it has no basis in reality. By your logic, every man is deeply afraid every night he goes to bed that his wife or girlfriend will cut off his penis while he's sleeping. And then, you know, have the entire country laugh at him as they barbecue wieners and cheer his female partner. It is frequently reinforced by the culture that females never rape, sexually assault or harass men, but that's largely a reflection of our inability to see and tendency to dismiss it when it happens. A man grabs a woman's crotch? He's practically a rapist, even if she liked it, he was supposed to ask first. Woman grabs a man's crotch? She's just a strong sexually empowered female who goes after what she wants, or at least it was just for fun and he didn't mind anyway, he probably liked it.

"Number 1 is evil, and one of my primary examples of why I expect terrorism from the left.

The fact that 12 people were shot to death tells you that every floor was covered in blood, including from the boot prints of the attackers.I can't help but be *absolutely furious* about people who *at first* said Je Suis, saw some of these pictures, and eventually said, ""It's their fault because they were offensive. They should just stop being so you can rationalize offices covered in blood because they said offensive things, rationalize a truck bomb is nothing.Then came their *guilt tripping* of people mourning for Paris and the victims of the Bataclan attack. ""How dare you! Lebanon had it worse a few weeks ago! What about Black Lives Matter? Did you ever consider that this is France's fault?""I was losing my shit reading the news that year.My point is, there's absolutely *no reason* to believe that the SJWs can't rationalize a terrorist attack inside the US against a government agency like Border Patrol or ICE, when they've already rationalized Charlie Hebdo and Bataclan. When somebody like Anderson Cooper comes out and rationalizes a left-wing terrorist attack on a federal building (a la Timothy McVeigh or Dwight Armstrong), and says: ""The *real* victims here are the victim's of Trump's immigration policy""; the resulting normie blowback will be so angry that it may ravage the political left, and possibly destroy the democratic party, in this country.

"Oh, no, I'm aware of that. I'm very well aware that reporting on news and events was never unbiased, not just in BBC, pretty much everywhere. I was born and grew up in a former Soviet satellite state in Eastern Europe which was ruled by a genuine hardcore communist party for half a century (not the Antifa larping fragile mangina cucks you see on the streets today). We essentially had one and only one news source distributed by the Party and all other alternative sources were completely subservient to the Party anyway. Anyone who even tried to think differently was sent on a one way trip to a camp... 'scuse me - ""labor"" camp. And this was going on until 1989. Trust me when I tell you - I am painfully aware and ""trained"" to spot bias, it's pretty much a second nature.I guess my point is that I'm not that much disappointed by the BBC bias, that's a given. But by the thing they are reporting on. Even in the ""good old"" communist propaganda days journalists were busy reporting on real issues, actual events, actual politics. Something that affects everyone, that everyone knows, everyone understands and cares about, something that is affecting your life, something that has a meaning. An election, politicians meeting, an armed conflict, economics, crime etc. Despite the obvious bias, news were actually meaningful and valuable news, not diluted garbage that makes no sense.Do you think that even half of the population now knows what ""misogynoir"" means when they hear or read this drivel on the news? Or what ""gamer girl"" is? Or ""preferred gender pronoun"" is? This is what I'm upset about. Not the bias, the fact that these ""giants"" of journalism are wasting tax payers money and time to report on completely useless garbage, the fact that some moron with a gender studies degree gets paid from our own pockets to present something so retarded as ""some chick got called a bitch while playing a video game"" as actual news.

I have to go out on a limb and guess that you have never been involved in any lifesaving profession and are simply flinging shit at a wall to see what sticks. Kissing a beloved corpse goodbye can only be considered ""abuse"" by the most emotionally stunted person on earth. And what that may, or may not, have to do with ""incentivizing murder"" or lifesaving"" is only obvious through the most transitive of straw-grasping lenses. In fact quite the opposite is trivially demonstrated. The very people who **do** go out and ""lifesave"" (e.g. firefighters, medics, ER staff) have a sense of humor that would traumatize the average lay person. Why?

E.g. vegans frequently overlap with people who have no kids for the sake of environment. Meanwhile rednecks have multiple kids. Either rednecks will keep converting into child-free vegans forever or vegans will just die out and rednecks take over.> If rape were determined to be part of human nature, you wouldn't think it would be OK, would rape is part of any animals nature. Humans included. See outcome of many wars. WWII being the most recent and well studied example. People did acknowledge for as long that it's not good and actively fight against it as well.

Not even making this shit up. You've heard of ""one rotten apple ruins the whole barrel""? Well, the police force is a rotten barrel that ruins all the apples. Cops are so corrupt it hurts. Everything from planting drugs to making speed traps to pay for their overtime (yeah, cops get paid a ton of overtime for appearing in traffic court... high incentive for them to abuse their powers and write lots and lots of tickets...) on top of the department getting a ton of funds from them; some small towns make millions of dollars a year on illegal speed traps. Short videos: Entire departments are in on this, and if you think it stops there, then your mom raised an even bigger moron than I head the saying ""power corrupts, absolute power corrupts Well, due to dumb, dickless, dipshits like you, cops have absolute power, which means they are absolutely corrupt. They shoot innocent, unarmed people in their own homes and don't get in trouble for it. They shoot innocent, unarmed people in broad daylight in public and don't get in trouble for it. They get caught lying or planting evidence and their boss gives them a paid vacation. You have to be an utter moron to still trust the police, with all the evidence we have of them being corrupt. If most cops were not corrupt, don't you think they would have squashed all the corrupt ones by now? A little logic would tell you that since corruption is so prevalent, then it must be the case that the majority, or at least a very large minority, of them are corrupt. They accept bribes and knockbacks. They lie and plant evidence, they falsify reports. The tradition of police corruption has been there since the beginning of America, pitting anti-vice vs vice for profit.If you ever manage to leave your mom's basement, you may have an encounter with them one day. You probably will change your mind about them at that point.What do *I* do? I'm a sound technician.

Dude you fundamentally fail to understand that social issues are so much more intrinsic to identity which has everything to do with what right/left divisions even are. Almost nobody has any principled attachment to economic ideology. The conservatives were close enough with the nazis on their social policy for them to align.You're ignorant as shit for believing that economic ideology is as much of a motivational factor as identity. Like I'm in California and it's vast majority left wing. We just voted on a proposition that forces EMT workers at private companies to be constantly on call and have to work through breaks. These bleeding heart retards just fucked over one of the lowest paid people in the medical field because they think it's saving lives. All this is proof of that every fucking ideological basis can easily be manipulated into betraying their economic beliefs if they think it will promote their social utopian belief structure.I don't need to educate your ass into understanding that fascism is inherently right wing regardless of whether or not it has elements of radical economic policy derived from the left.Fuck off.

"I thought it was decent when it came out, but Waid is overrated. A big tell in a flawed story is if your introduce a key conflict--it may not be the main conflict, it may only be the second or third if it's a key conflict to the story, and it's resolved by some lazy deus ex machina (in this instance, dei ex machina embodied in Shazam), that resolves a critical story is flawed. One of the big conceits of the book was that there was this prophecy about the bat and the eagle in conflict. through three issues it was implied it was Bats v Supes, then SHAZAM PLOT TWIST, it's Bats v Wonder Woman, and in issue four they're duking it out and SHAZAM! instead of resolving the intractable conflict between side A and side B...humans decide to nuke super humans (thus ending the conflict between Bats and WW...which was a freaking prophecy and treated as critical to the story up to that point) and Supes and a brainwashed Shazam have to stop the bomb (and half fail in doing so). Ok. You ended the Bats v WW conflict with a distraction. It's a freaking Elseworlds story. You are given the license to have Let key characters die. Let one side win. Have cajones. Re. Solve. The. Con. Flict. Waid is tame. His personal antics have more drama and consequences than his fiction. Dude could never create anything new, write some science fiction novel, build a universe. He's a fanboy that was competent in managing the month to month tension of comic book writing, but good at nothing else. Neil Gaiman could invent and write outside of comics. Joe Hill. Even Kevin Smith, who started in film then went to comics in back. That's impressive. But these fanboy writers are just dull hacks (Waid, Busiek). I don't need grim and gritty or anti-grim and gritty or any theme or motif, just invention and creativity. I never, ever understood why those fanboy writers were put on a pedestal in the mid to late 90s. Tame writers. They're the same quality as Roy Thomas, with the exception that Roy a) actually created new borderline A lister characters (Vision) and quality B listers (Black Knight) (Waid and Busiek have done neither), B) Thomas was responsible for much of the Marvel Universe webbing, creating connections across character families that created the networked feel of the Marvel U in the 70s (see what he did with Asgard and the Eternals and ingenious for comic writing) and carried in the 80s (that even Lee and Kirby (the creators) failed to do), and C) isn't worshipped as a god like Waid and Busiek are. I'm listening to Scriver's broadcast yesterday on Waid and DinC, and yikes....I'm torn between wanting these stories about Waid to be true and not be true, because if they are true, man, what a despicable human being (him and Dan Slott) and if not true, then that type of trolling accusations just degrade society further (in our anonymous oriented culture, I don't know what to believe is true when people speak roughly anonymously about me a skeptic).",0

"So, I take the time to answer your question as thoroughly as I can and you respond by going off on a tangent about how the SCOC didn't do their job SCOC case was about whether Khadr's rights were violated. I am no lawyer but I don't think the scope of their job included trying to figure out how Khadr ended up fighting for the enemy as a 15yo. Despite what your (and my) knee-jerk response is, he was a minor at this time. I believe that the SCOC ruling is fair.The debate about whether Khadr was radicalized by his family or not is an entirely separate subject. The debate over whether he should have been considered a child soldier or not is another entirely separate subject. His family ties and history is irrelevant to the SCOC ruling and to the eventual settlement. You can't choose to ignore a person's rights based on family history or you like it or not, Khadr was a minor when all of this happened. I don't know if you have children, but I do, and having raised a few teenagers and am in the process of raising a few more I can fully understand how a child can look and mostly act like a adult yet not have the mind nor ability to fully think as one. This is a fact that a lot of people forget about teenagers. Especially if Khadr's family is as you describe, Khadr may have not had much of a chance to do the right thing due to his upbringing. I know I sure as hell would never have sent my 15 to a war zone to act as a translator. That's probably the biggest WTF in all of this.In a way I rather like that the US immediately tried to find a way to gain access to Khadr's settlement in order to help not only Speer's family, but also Morris, who was wounded. I think it's rather telling how there was no suit mentioned until there was blood in the water, so to speak. Seeking justice would have been filing suit against Khadr and his parents whether there was $10.5M on the table or not; Much like Canada's settlement with Khadr, there was no suit filed until it made financial sense. ""Justice"" isn't this nuanced.I retract my statements about Harper being your guy; Most people here think that Harper was flawless and that Bernier is some kind of political messiah. As I said in my original post in this thread, there are a lot of things to slag Trudeau over, but this $10.5M settlement is not one of them. Khadr's payout and everything leading up to it are a result of Harper's decisions.",0

The story changed various times because people kept pointing out how such claims were wrong. Firstly Michael wasn't the captain, nor was she the first black protagonist, nor female protagonist.

"> Are we sure about this? If people argue for socially liberal positions such as - being pro-choice on abortion, legalisation of cannabis, rehabilitation of offenders rather than incarceration/ death penalty, legalisation of gay marriage, racial and gender equality - are they really called ""right wing"" ? Because to me, that statement seems to fly in the face of reality. I would say that people who take those positions are generally referred to as left wing or liberal, particularly by right wing commentators.I was specifically referring to free speech absolutism. That's a liberal position. It has been redefined as ""right wing"" in today's culture war, by those who consider themselves progressive leftists.>This one is very easy to debunk. Here's a link to a report on how Amnesty International (usually regarded as a liberal organisation) has campaigned against FGM and the treatment of women in Islamic societies.Sure. But when people like Ayaan Hirsi Ali do the same thing they're accused of being ""right wing extremists."" As is Maajid Nawaz even though he's of the moderate left. Even Christopher Hitchens, who was a *literal Trotskyist*, got accused of being an 'extreme right winger' for his stances on the Islamic world's treatment of gays and women. Sure, maybe it doesn't happen every time. But you can't pretend that people who express concern over how bad civil liberties are in the Islamic world and suggest that perhaps Islam, at least in the form in which it is most prominent, is standing in the way of *don't* get accused of being racist or xenophobic or a story about Femen - again definitely a left wing organisation - protesting treatment of women in Islamic societies.I am not familiar with Femen but from what little I've heard they don't count as a organ of the establishment left.",0

"I'm going to devils advocate against Crowder for a second:I think that if you allowed for a rather generous definition of ""Rape Culture"", a rape culture _actually does exist_ on college campuses. Hear me out. At least, up until the recent Title IX insanity, here's what's going to happen. Say you have been raped, assaulted, or otherwise have a credible accusation. You go to the school (your first mistake!) over this. What do they do?Obviously, rape is really really bad and the school wants to prevent it, stop it, and bring consequences on the predator. But... there's other factors.Maybe it turns out that the accused is from a very politically family, and if you pursue action against hi, his parents make trouble for you. Maybe his cousin is a major donor to the school, or he is a star student in sports or academics and has a really great reputation that the school gets to enjoy by proxy. Or maybe, maybe the school just wants to keep their risk of reputation damage to a minimum.It doesn't really matter the specifics. The fact remains that _*the university's priority is to protect the university, not the students*_. The university is working with HR bureaucracy incentives: make the problem go away as cheaply and quickly as possible so we can get back to business as usual. Often times, and _especially_ in more ambiguous situations (everything from regret-sex to situations), the easiest way to do that is to take the bare minimum token action so the victim feels like you did something, and then sweep it under the rug. No investigation that makes rumours spread, no spooky increase in rape stats for your campus, no potentially making powerful people mad. Just Make It Go Away. If you're someone who is actually a victim, and you actually want justice, and you go to the and this happens, you could be forgiven for believing that this is of a ""rape culture"". From your perspective it sure looks like _rape happened and they didn't care_. But in reality it's just a natural consequence of the fact that bureaucracies follow incentives and the university has some very strong incentives hanging over it, much stronger than one hysterical freshman.But I would argue that it is absurd to call this a 'rape culture'. Even if the situation I've laid out means that it is literally true that there is a culture that covers up rape, it is still incorrect to call that a rape culture. Why? Because 'rape culture' has a connotation that this is about rape specifically, and that it's at least partially intentional. In fact, the situation is actually caused by a higher level, more general thing, for which the rape scenario is just one of many consequences. If anything, it's an ""incentive culture"" or a culture"".Of course, the fundamental cause of this whole scenario is a mistake on the part of the victim: Why the _*fuck*_ would you go to _university over a _crime_. The university is NOT fair and NOT neutral. They are in fact heavily biased in favour of ""whatever costs them less time, money, and effort"". They're NOT your friends. The university solves problems for _the university_ and sometimes the problem (to them) is the victim who won't drop the issue. All of this, ALL OF IT, is trivially solved if people do what they're supposed to do and _*report crimes to the police*_. For an analogy, imagine an HR department at work. Imagine you have a problem with someone at work. Doesn't matter what it is. Do you report them to HR? What if the problem is that this other asshole is constantly muttering insults under his breath towards you. Oh, also, this asshole has been here for 15 years and saved the company from bankruptcy. And you started 3 weeks ago. If you go to the HR department they're immediately going to think ""oh, seriously? The veteran employee _saved our company_ and this dipshit who hasn't even been here for three years can't take a joke about it? We have to get the newbie to shut up before the veteran gets pissed and quits to take that job at Google we know he's been eyeing"". They want _the situation_ to go away but that is not the same as solving your problem.The absolute best case scenario for you going to HR is that HR brings in the senior guy and tells him to knock it off. And now he's mad. He knows that you narc'd him out to HR for the things he said and now he's pissed. Out of spite he'll give you terrible performance reviews and you'll never get promoted. He'll make even snarkier comments but always in a way that's plausibly deniable. By going to HR over this, the only thing you did was make your problem worse.You could look at this situation and say ""SEE, THIS COMPANY HAS A HARASSMENT CULTURE"" but that's not true. Actually, this company has one guy who is kind of an asshole, that everybody kind of hates, but also the company realizes that there's some unpleasant realities about the world that can't be escaped. If you're the victim in this situation, you could spent your whole life getting bitter over it and complain about how corporate america has a harassment culture. You could see your career stagnate as you spent too much time complaining and not enough time doing your job. You could turn into a pathetic shell of a human being. Or you could man up, take some simple and commonsense actions to stop the petty jokes (eg maybe avoid him in the hallway), and if the behaviour is sufficiently severe, go to the police over it. TL;DR: Retarded 21-year-old children don't understand that bureaucracies will always work for their own best interest and label this ""rape culture""",0

"> How does believing we live in a patriarchy mean you don’t believe in equality?It means you believe in ""equality"" which is achieved by applying double standards to make up for the inherent inequality of being a woman in a patriarchal society. Egalitarians, by and large, *do not* believe in feminism, because they do not believe we live in a patriarchy, and so do not believe that we need to discriminate against men to achieve equality. > how is our society not numerous laws and policies that favour women over men. Because women are more likely to graduate from both secondary and tertiary education. Because men get longer custodial sentences for the same crimes with the same criminal histories as women. Because it's generally acceptable to express sexist thoughts regarding men whereas it is seen as bigoted to express similar thought regarding women. Because if you start talking about men's issues and how they don't get the attention they deserve, you're likely to get labeled a bigot.",0

"It is tinfoil hat thinking.A more answer is that GOG/CDPR is a relatively small firm headquartered in Poland. And Poland is a deeply conservative Catholic country that experienced a lengthy period of misrule by crackpot Marxists who spouted increasingly preposterous propaganda even as the country swirled around the drain for decades. This history has had a deep impact on the local political culture and the local sense of humor. Its really different from the bubble the average Kotaku scrivner is surrounded by. (When thinking of such, I always imagine Diane from Bojack \_slightly\_ more interested in video games and sans rich husbands)To the extent anyone in Warsaw is even aware of the latest American SJW cause du jour, the natural tendency is going to be toward mocking the talking points, not kowtowing toward them.But I doubt there is any genuine effort to deliberately offend anyone.

I don't think there can really can be dispute of that - though it is also true of many different kinds of activists for many different kinds of freedoms or other political and social goals in these same places. Also, calling those women's rights activists ""feminists"" and their adversaries is not always accurate, as feminism is an explicit ideological position with a rich theoretical foundation (whatever any individual may personally think of that foundation) and not simply any effort to make things less shitty for women.

"Look , your starting to arguments, but to prove you ME right.1. Yes. If a stupid girl started ""harassing"" a grown ass man by calling him names , ANY NAMES, and she would not stop, and she was in NO WAY apologetic or indicative of stopping, THEN she should not be surprised AT ALL when she gets her ass WOOPED. Why? BECAUSE YOU SHOULDN'T HARASS PEOPLE! Sometimes the ""payment"" for harassing another person is a FOOT IN YOUR of verb1 a : exhaust, fatigue I have been harassed with the toil of verse —William Wordsworth b (1) : to annoy persistently was harassing his younger brother(2) : to create an unpleasant or hostile situation for especially by uninvited and unwelcome verbal or physical conduct was being harassed by her classmates claims that the police were unfairly harassing himTHOUGHT N@#$ and HONKEY are ""just words"" They are ""uninvited and unwelcome words (deemed so by their targets)"" Which to answer 2:That's a SUCKERS QUESTION, and I'M NOT A SUCKER.See, I am black, BUT I AM NOT""the Black Ambassador of explaining to white people why black people do stupid shit.""I DON'T KNOW WHY THEY DO THIS SHIT, I JUST GREW UP AROUND IT.I DON'T WORK for the NCAA.I am not Paid by the society of gainful Negroes, or whatever.AND I WORK FOR MONEY.So since I HAVE NEVER received my ""defending or explaining black people"" check in the mail, They SHALL NOT BE DEFENDED OR my fee is ludicrously you'll gets no answer from me, cause It ain'ts my job to explain a race of people actions to you.Now if you paid attention, ALL of MY COMMENTS FOCUS ON of how its done.NOW THE REASON A WORD IS SO IMPORTANT IS THIS.It is CLEAR in BOTH the above example AND YOUR EXAMPLE. That people are harassing others. What did they use to Harass their they ""KNEW"" would hurt them or rile them up. THAT'S WHY THE WORD IS IMPORTANT IN THIS CONTEXT.Both girls in both examples could have said ""rutabaga casserole"" with the same intensity and it probably WOULD HAVE WENT NOWHERE.We as a species, use WORDS for their meaning and SINCE THE INTENT FROM BOTH GIRLS WAS TO HARASS their targets.They chose the Right ""Words"" to Achieve their goal - a Harried Target.N@#$ for blacks with the white girlHonkeys for white with the black girl.We communicate with words, like I am to you now.But communication HINGES on us BOTH HAVING THE SAME DEFINITION OF THE WORDS, or there is or no communication at all.So, when Either girl in Either scenario CHOSE to HARASS another person, they went for the best weapons in their arsenal, THE WORDS THAT EVERYBODY UNDERSTANDS THEIR MEANING TO BE""You piece of shit, I am above you/or you are worthless by virtue of something out of your control - YOUR COLOR ALONE. and I will ALWAYS be better than you because of your INFERIOR Make.""Now If that ISN'T harassment, I don't know what is.Both girls could have just said ""cherry lemonade"" and people would have just been confused and some people might hand not got punched.So words. Words are important.NOW I GET what you are saying. WHY fight over a word?And I'll say this.It's not the WORD, its the INTENTION BEHIND THE WORDS that makes it harassment, a threat, or not.And in the real world. UNCHECKED HARASSMENT BECOMES A THREAT.A Bully who calls you names and picks on your every day, soon LEVELS UP to ACTUALLY KICKING YOUR ASS AND ROBING YOU.If you let them.People from poorer neighborhoods (like me) know all to well to NOT LET HARASSMENT GO UNCHECKED, or it could cost you YOUR LIFE one day , down the road.And getting to your point.Also, I have learned THAT YOU CANT GO FIGHTING EVERY TIME SOMEBODY CALLS YOU A BAD WORD OR HARASSES YOU.It's the secret to Growing Old. ;)But you have to be the judge for yourself in each situation.And I say again. Do not be surprised if when you harass somebody, you get your ass you're just being a mean evil dickhead piece of shit.Words or not, it's still the Harassment.

"> Oh, I get the reasoning. I don't subscribe to it, though. I think the definition of ""mentally ill"" is far too loose, and many of them should and could have gotten help to relieve it before it got to a point of becoming criminally dangerous.is that the fault of the sick person or the people around them? because, for example, some aren’t aware they’re and episodes featuring visions that don’t actually exist are quite real to them. they can’t tell the difference between their illness and all, you don't get off of drunk driving because you were too drunk to make a rational decision. likewise, mentally ill people that commit crimes are held accountable for them, sometimes with a measure of leniency that accounts for their and driving is not the same though. if someone is sufficiently mentally ill and fall off their meds, they can’t tell they have. and this doesn’t mean they see pink elephants that night, it’s a slow spiral until they do, and by that time pink elephants make total sense. these kinds of lapses are ameliorated because what they suffer from is permanent and clouds judgment beyond what alcohol does. they didn’t choose to go and drink/see elephants, they were born with it. likewise personal while drunk is much more important because you choose how much to drink, how drunk you get, and then drive and hit someone.>You get put in jail because you chose to drink and left yourself a means to drive. I think many of these people chose not to get help when they were of sounder mind, and should be punished for the exact same illness is still a deeply taboo subject, and plenty of people prefer to avoid inpatient psychiatric wards because, let’s be real, those places are hell on earth. that and there are lasting from diagnoses. even if you take your meds regularly and have never had problems, nearly every employer will probably turn you down from a job because of the diagnosis, even though you’ve never had an insane episode and have a perfect record.it’s that people are sometimes unable to be aware that they aren’t taking medication, and are mostly rejected by society for a flaw in how they were born. you don’t blame a dog for peeing on the carpet when it’s only ever peed on carpets - that’s it’s whole experience and all it knows. you understand where the dog comes from and work with it to achieve a better result.as i’ve already said, this doesn’t excuse the crimes committed, and they do receive punishment for it. but downplaying actual mental illness or saying that people choose to be mentally is just fucked.",0

Even then what lots of people don't seem to understand is that if a government doesn't allow you to defend even legally at all with improved on the stop weapons) with weapons then they don't give a shit whether you live or die- which makes them a shit abusive can get wanting to have a sweet spot for that, but it's pretty clear most governments just think they are a better breed of human than those they rule over.

Except in some rare case, these events are not a poor little young Billy cowering in the corner as predator Patty is shoving her tits in his face.

Here's a simple advice: Do. Not. Play. At all. Play games that are narrative driven and have a good time. Proudly select the lowest difficulty. Cheat like there is no tomorrow.

If you ""do not want to be good"" at it, you are Dead Weight for your team. You make things worse for way more people than just little ol' yourself. You WILL get shit.

Do not expect a pat on the head, a cookie and a trophy for ruining the fun of other people.

"The fact that men are 98%+ of all workplace deaths and serious injuries, or spend more time commuting, never seems to be raised or questioned by feminists. It seems to be simply as a mater of individual choice. If this gender discrepancy can be dismissed so easily, then it gives rise to the strong suspicion that are simply greedily wanting money. At the BBC we know full well why Carrie Grace got paid a bit less as China editer than the America and Brussels editers. If you can't see that people are more interested in Trump and Brexit than they are in China, and that as a result those stations are on air 24/7 whereas the Beijing reporter is just once a week on Radio 4, then I'm afraid you're simply deluded. Sir Bruce Forsyth got paid loads more than Tess Dailey on Strictly Come Dancing. Was that gender After all, they were doing the same job. Of COURSE it wasn't - Bruce was a legend who'd performed with Bob Hope and Fred Astaire - and no-one could pick Tess Dailey out of a line-up.

"Ok, this can be a long one. People may think that i'm a hypocrite in saying that we should oppose feminism because they have a lot of sexist and misandrist feminists in their movement, while still I still support the MRM.First of all I don't hate feminists in the sense that I want them to be killed, hurt, raped, have their rights stripped from them or any such thing. I don't want any harm for them, or to have something bad happen to them as a form of I still hate feminists nonetheless. Why? Because I feel that every single one of them, even if they didn't do any sexist thing to men or said any misandrist thing to them. We are all humans, men and women alike, we both can be sexist and hateful, we both have sexist assholes who can infiltrate a a good movement and turn it into a hate one.The difference between feminism and the MRM is that feminism is more than 100 years old, it appeared in the the late 19th century, but we as movement we are still relatively new compared to them.Unlike us, they have a lot of power and influence. The most we can have is some mysogynistic assholes who spout some sexist nonsense in an Internet forum. They, in the other hand, can block laws, can pass laws, have feminist presidents in their side, have big feminists journalists, judges and professors. They can and already did a big damage to men.They did more than just say some sexist shit in the Internet, they actually stopped us many times when we wanted to have our rights or have equality for men under the law or socially. And despite that a lot of feminists labeled every single MRA as a mysogynist, and with us being a small movement without influence or power, we couldn't do shit.While every single feminists defended feminism by saying the famous phrase '' those are not real feminists, real feminism is about equality'' and enforced the notion that any single one who criticize feminism is a either a mysogynist male or a woman who suffer from internalized served as a shield for the feminist movement, which was a platform for misandrist and sexist cunts to hurt men and stop them from getting the equality that they wanted.The only thing that they did is just say that feminism is a movement for equality and that those are not real feminists. Instead of actually doing something, removing those feminists from the position of power that they have, and actually reversing the damage.But they only served as a shield, as a defense for the feminist movement, the platform that those misandrists used to fuck men up. Those misandrists who not only had a platform from where they can do the sexist shit that they wanted, they didn't had a real threat to them, since even the feminists who claim to be good didn't try to actively remove them and correct what they have done.Those good feminists defended feminism even if it made things worse for men, because they used it to get their rights,they used men as a stepping stone to have what they want. The ''good'' feminists had their rights, the bad feminists had the vengeance that they wanted from men. Those good feminists didn’t want to oppose those misandrists who had the power, because they wanted to preserve their movement so that they can have their rights even if it meant to have men as a stepping stone.So good feminists, bad feminists, both for men had a role in using feminism as hate movement to fuck men up. And that's why I hate. And I don't the MRM to become like feminism. I don't want us to fall in the same mistake.",0

"No need to throw patriotism it would have to be defined in a way that don´t enter in conflict with “teamwork and cooperation” or the principles of the and usually isn´t defined that way (neither nationalism). We could enter a deep discussion about the meaning of the word “country” and it´s relationship with culture, and therefore how patriotism would have to be defined to not considering other people in other countries “less of a priority” or how loving your country wouldn´t imply loving other people less, we would also have to question ourselves if an abstract concept (or a physical piece of land or territory) do deserve to be loved as well to agree on the differences between patriotism and nationalism. In any case I much prefer a single culture based on the principles of the enlightenment than different cultures (different countries), of course a single culture isn´t how the world is right now, but I prefer to defend what I think would be good rather than defend an imperfect existing model just because it is under the attack of an even worse model.The problem with trying to associate a movement with many other things that are not part of it and calling anyone who disagree with a few of them “retarded” (some people would acuse you of ableism for that) is that people aren’t going to be convinced by that nor are going to take you seriously for that matter. A big problem with feminism is that is an ideology that convinces people that whoever don’t agree with them completely are deeply flawed, and therefore their ideas and opinions can be discarded without Your approach is much the same, you also consider yourself as in possession of the truth, the main difference is that you consider anyone who disagrees with you, even if only on a few things on a long list, as mentally impaired (and therefore their opinions can be discarded too).

Summary: Rekieta Law goes through Lawyer Mark Zaid's extremely long motion to dismiss Richard Meyer's lawsuit against Mark Waid for tortious interference and defamation. Zaid claims Waid is not subject to Texas jurisdiction and does some extreme twisting of logic and words to reach that major hilarious points are1. Waid/Zaid claiming he has no business in Texas but he regularly attends conventions there and even offered to do business with the owner of Antarctic Press in exchange for them not publishing Meyer's comic book.2. Waid/Zaid claim that defamation was never done in Texas yet there is of Waid repeating his defaming points against Meyer at a convention in Texas.3. Waid/Zaid claim Waid did not initiate contact with Antractic Press. Waid's own Tweets and previous statement contradict this.4. Waid/Zaid claim Waid did not know Antarctic Press was located in Texas. Waid stated he knew the owners when he Tweeted he was calling them and called a Texas phone number.The lengthy livestream where Rekieta Law tears apart the motion and is in full rant mode can be found here: [,1
"She's so deeply upset that she's trying not to grin half the time she's being She obviously thinks it's hilarious that she got caught having sex in public, but I think she's too stupid to understand why that makes her a sex offender. I reckon in her opinion a sex offender is a rapist or someone who sexually assaults another, not someone who has sex in front of kids and families on a public beach. Not so much a pussy pass though. Gun show likely got a harsher sentence because of his prior cocaine conviction. He was grinning like a twat until he realised he was going to prison for being a sex offender and not a roid rage cocaine offender, gulp!",1
"Being gay myself, this is why I've criticized the community's propensity to label every possible preference or presentation, it just confuses everyone and creates stupid and meaningless labels. Of course, this just got me called a bigot. I've been told I'm ""gray-ace homoromantic"" because I'm not huge on sex but I'm only interested in romantic relationships with men. I've been told I'm because I don't like doing one night stands and I like sex more for emotional reasons (feeling close to someone, feeling loved and love the feeling of caring for a man) than I do physical reasons. Been told I'm fluid because I think some heterosexual erotica is hot. I've been told I'm an ""otter"" because I'm hairy but am too slim to be a ""bear"". Been called a ""stone butch"" because I fall on the more masculine end of the spectrum, prefer to be the dominant partner, and love taking care of my boyfriends. It's just stupid. Date who you like, wear whatever clothes you like, do your hair however you like, have or don't have sex, etc. Stop thinking every little thing needs a label. Also, kind of a side note, I just want to say how interesting it is how many of these people I see say ""not interested in cis straight men"". As far as I know, there's no inherent physical differences between straight, gay, or bisexual cis men, so it's clearly a political thing (trying to undermine cis straight guys), not an actual sexual preference. That's another issue, stop making your sexuality and gender expression a political thing.",1

"I think the reason they want to flood the voterbase with people from third world countries is that 1st worlders are better educated, less tolerant of corruption, are attuned to the notion that the government is subordinate to the people, they're less collectivist and more individualist, and they're aware of and value their rights more than 3rd worlders. This makes 1st worlders harder to control and harder to oppress than 3rd worlders, since 3rd worlders are used to being by the state, and 1st worlders aren't. It's by design that our system produces people who are hostile to tyranny. That's an essential feature of our civilization. But that's an obstacle to [the powermongers in our midst.]( The 1st world ruling class are jealous of the 3rd world ruling classes because the 3rd world dictators have populations that are completely cowed and feel subordinate to the ruling class, which gives the ruling class absolute power. The 1st world ruling class want that for themselves, [so they're importing it by the boatload.]( Soon they'll have enough to outvote the original 1st worlders, and our ruling class will finally have the 3rd world dictatorship they've always dreamed of. No more public criticism, no more elections threatening their power every four years, just them, in power, forever. That's what they're striving for. That's why they're bent on importing millions of third worlders. That's why they're trying to crush any opposition to their strategy through [lies]( [censorship]( [name calling]( and These are nothing less than tyrants trying to consolidate power.",1

"In the state of California an engagement ring is a promise! Not an gift. By law it has to be given back unless its after marriage. What a fucking entitled slut cunt!""In California we turn to a law dating back to 1939 which specifically addresses engagement rings and other gifts in of Code section 1590; it states: Where either party to a contemplated marriage in this State makes a gift of money or property to the other on the basis or assumption that the marriage will take place, in the event that the donee refuses to enter into the marriage as contemplated or that it is given up by mutual consent, the donor may recover such gift or such part of its value as may, under all of the of the case, be found by a court or jury to be just. In this case the ""donor"" is the person (i.e., the man) giving the engagement ring, and the ""donee"" is the person (i.e., the woman) receiving it. A gift in of marriage can be revoked, unlike other gifts. Thus, California law is very clear on what happens to the ring - if the woman calls off the wedding, it goes back to the man. Also, if both parties agree that the wedding is off then the man gets the ring back. This California law has wide ranging impact for property given in of marriage. In an important case on the subject - Shaw v. Shaw (1964) 227 Cal.App.2d 159, a man and woman lived together for four years. He placed her name on real property because he relied on her promise that she would marry him when her divorce was final. The couple separated before marrying and the woman eventually married another. The court awarded all property back to the man because she failed to marry him. This has an impact on our society today because of the number of couples living together before marriage.""",1

"Of course we do.>In the early-to-mid 20th century, the phrase ""politically correct"" was used to describe strict adherence to a range of ideological orthodoxies. In 1934, The New York Times reported that Nazi Germany was granting reporting permits ""only to pure 'Aryans' whose opinions are politically correct.""[2]>As Marxist-Leninist movements gained political power, the phrase came to be associated with accusations of dogmatic application of doctrine, in debates between American Communists and American Socialists. This usage referred to the Communist party line which, in the eyes of the Socialists, provided ""correct"" positions on all political matters. That is the history and that is how it is implemented today. Regardless of attempts to ~~redefine~~ mask the function, that is what it is at collective orthodoxy is *always* a problem, always really matter if the garnish is religious or ""secular"", it's still saturated in emotional beliefs rather than objective facts, and that's why it is described as pseudo-religion. It follows the same social mechanics, the fervor, the ostracization of non-believers, the denial of objective facts for the purposes of The Party, the substitution of science with the same manipulations of brow beating or guilt-tripping or other forms of shaming.This is one end of [PC culture]( as an example of how bad it can get. *Abject* science denialism, rejecting dissent with manipulations according to PC ""rules"".If science is ""oppressive"" then your views are not in line with reality a lot of these people are marginalized. It's just not for the reasons they claim(skin, genitals, etc). It is because they are pants on head retarded. It's that they think being ""politically correct"" has any basis in reality over being *factually correct.* For this reason, there are some times when marginalization is called for. Same reason we marginalize other stupid ideas or ideologies which have the end result of being objectively bad for society(the intent is irrelevant).Why is intent irrelevant? Because good intent often has ridiculously bad results. Contrary to what these mental midgets learned in early life, it's not just ""the thought that counts"". It's the *impact*.There's nothing but good intent behind most anti-vaxxers. They don't set out to breath new life into virtually extinct diseases, but it is a very real potential impact of their suggested plan. Nobody really thinks they're the bad guy( barring and the like, as well as some epiphany about how they've made stupid decisions that got them into the situation they're in...Why? these are statistical outliers).""The greatest trick the devil ever pulled was convincing people that he didn't exist"" bears some merit in this case, and I say this even as an atheist. People too unintelligent to know they're a danger to themselves and others, or those that know and successfully hide it behind platitudes and lip-service that sounds good to a casual correctness"" is one such term, as is ""Social Justice"" and a wide variety of language of leftist orthodoxy buzzwords.",1
Has anyone noticed that when something rather or ridiculous happens it doesn't matter if it's true the media will just post it up without thinking and it doesn't matter if it all gets proven to be bullshit they will act like they had nothing to do with women like this one getting so famous in the first place?I'm reminded of the Mars scam which I was deeply suspicious of right from the beginning. They were posting it up left and right and when it was found out that the people behind this were just con artists the media instead of correcting themselves just went silent and pretended it never happened or if they did correct themselves it was just one or two articles and that's it.This behaviour is constant and they are largely responsible for the state of things in the west today. They do zero fact checking and as long as it will get them clicks they'll post it up especially if it happens to be something like this where they can peddle their worldview and make it out that anybody who is disagreeing with what this woman did is an evil evil misogynist and the patriarchy is real.,1

"I assume you're talking about US history (and leaving aside the gross and murderous injustices of the slave system, which is a book in of itself). Is she aware that voting rights for white men once involved property restrictions? Just as a random example, in Rhode Island in the 1830s, unpropertied men raised a militia and there was violence (Dorr Rebellion). It took decades before property restrictions were lifted for men. It was a slow and unsexy process, so your GF has probably never heard of it.There were plenty of men's rebellions against economic injustices. Ever heard of Shays' Rebellion? Broke out right after the American Revolution in western mainly poor farmers. Whiskey Rebellion? Poor farmers in western Pennsylvania had one item they could sell-- whiskey-- and the government put a tax on whiskey which was burdensome on them. They were not spared taxation because they were men. How about the Anti-Rent War in upstate NY? Poor farmers revolted against a kind of semi-feudal landlord system in the Hudson river valley.Is she aware of labor history? The US had a very violent labor history in the 1800s. Working people men) clamored for things like a 40 hour work week and weekends off. Does your girlfriend like having the weekend off? I assume she does. Does she think male capitalists freely gave their male workers days off *because they were men?* Did she read the book ""The Jungle""? Jurgis isn't exactly living high on the hog for most of the book.If you do your homework, you'll see that rights and benefits were never gifted out to common men, *qua men.* There was often a struggle involved. Powerful men do not favor less powerful men. The factory owner is more likely to spend his money on a fur coat for the wife than parcel out benefits to the men on the factory floor. This isn't rocket the leaders of the early women's movement at Seneca Falls were all comfortably middle class (at least) and had support from their husbands (oh *and servants,* they sometimes had servants too). For instance, Elizabeth Cady Standon and Lucretia Mott met at an antislavery conference in London; their husbands had paid for their tickets. It is a bit rather hard to claim that you're oppressed when your husband not only buys your steamship tickets across the Atlantic but *also* helps you to organize the first women's rights conference because you had no experience organizing conferences before. Right? If you look, you find all of the early women's rights heroines (who struggled!) *nearly all* of them came out of middle class households of the Victorian era. That was the first large group of women in human history to have free time. Consider the significance of that.",1

"Forgive me, it's late, and I haven't slept.The BanOut: 2018 initiative targeted racist right wing subreddits to shut them down. The questions are: 1: What constitutes as racist, as there is a legitimate problem with the left calling those that don't agree with them racists, or even citing factual accredited statistics as racist.2: Were any anti-white, or other racist pages or accounts targeted? Is there a list available of the subs and users targeted by BanOut so that we can go see for ourselves what the racist content was that warranted banning?The fact that this BanOut initiative goes *at least* all the way to upper management in Reddit staff, Director of Policy at Reddit, Jessica Ashooh, who comes from a pretty questionable background in this instance; so that means that Reddit in some regards supports this initiative, and being they're a left leaning site, that's concerning, but not all that coupled with you ""contacted a certain admin to let him/her know what I was going to do."" This admin who also works for left leaning Reddit, gave you the go ahead to troll the BanOut initiative to get it shut down. Which is kind've a funny thing to do for someone who legitimately believes the pages and accounts Ban:Out were targeting legitimately were racist.My theory I posit here, is that this was all an inside job to erase evidence and connections of Reddit staff and others to BanOut: 2018, as nothing changed besides the centralized hub and all evidence of BanOut was destroyed. Everything (pertaining to my questions above about what constitutes as racism) that was targeted and banned by BanOut is still banned. No subs have been restored, no users reinstated. BanOut is still very much active, but now it is invisible, and every connection to those who participated in it, and everything they (potentially falsely) deemed racist has been erased.

"> Actress Keira Knightley went on the Ellen Degeneres show on Tuesday and said that her daughters are banned from watching Cinderella and The Little Mermaid, why? Because she wants her daughters to know she doesn’t need no man…no really.

Don’t! Rescue yourself, she fucking doesn’t watch the damn takes her fate and life into her own hands and sells her voice for legs to go get the man she wants. Eric doesn’t save Ariel from *shit* — she saves *him* from drowning and then wants his dick. Stuff happens on land, Ariel breaks the agreement, and then Ursula takes Ariel captive per the terms of their contract, but King Triton — Ariel’s *father* — offers himself in her place, and then Eric and Ariel *work together* to kill Ursula and save Triton and the world.Keira Knightley is banning her daughter from watching a movie that features a female protagonist who retains complete agency for almost the entire movie and directly drives 100% of the action because she herself has evidently not seen the movie and knows nothing about it. The core message of Disney’s adaptation of The Little Mermaid is that pursuing your dreams is *hard as fuck* and any number of things can go disastrously wrong — including things that will be *your own fault* for trusting the wrong people or taking the wrong approach — but that if you don’t take on that risk and that then your chance of achieving your goals is movie didn’t kick off the Disney Renaissance by being shitty or backwards, it did it because its themes resonate at a fundamental archetypal level.

"I don't share your positive outlook. However, I do think that the comparison to the evolution of art in the past two centuries is being mimicked by now, we find ourselves in the era of gaming, where some people are trying to figure out new ways to approach videogame development and playability, but generally speaking most participants are either cynical actors or snotty elitists that think their shit don't stink. And just like with art, we are now seeing the kindling embers of the post movement, with games such as Doom, BoTW, Mario Odyssey, RE7, SoulCalibur VI (and a few others), where the cynicism and corporate bullshit is worn-out, and the people involved just want to make games that core audiences have been begging for years, just updated to modern sensibilities and tech specs.I'm sure you're now asking ""But isn't that good? We're getting rid of the ideologues, right?"", to which I say no, not really. See, left a stain in the art world that will likely NEVER go away. Audiences, be them philistines or not, got it into their heads that being an artist means being a snooty cuntbag sniffing their own farts and making up excuses for pointless drivel. Critics, and the elitists in the art world, have also collectively agreed to circle-jerk that notion around. How's things going for post-post modernists? Not well, because even if their work is appreciated, even if it finds an audience, people just think of it as ""Oh right, classic-style art"", and don't give it any further thought, leaving new creators to either become another cog, or fall into obscurity.Can this be solved? Well, the PPM in art is still going, under 30 years of existance, give or take, and only a FEW videogames fall into the equivalent state. But videogames are much more than Art, so the mediocrity of AAA shlock and the douchecannoes flooding the market will still present a colossal challenge to anyone that doesn't have the backing of a major studio. I mean, Return of the Obra Dinn is kinda PPM, but it still doesn't much going for it, and doesn't seem to have much replay value.",1

"I got called an NPC the other day.The person doing so explicitly called my Facebook a ""Russian NPC account,"" accusing me of being one of the Russian Nazis that have conquered the US.I really can't tell anymore *what's* going on.

Reasons, and part of that ""operating in secret"" involves operating blatantly out in the open, and flashing hidden signals to identify themselves to all their supporters, and that these hidden signals serve to identify them among each other, even though they don't need to do so because they're working behind the scenes and all in cahoots, but these hidden signals are so poorly hidden that they can be used to identify them by the masses. . .

As a self-conscious teenager, if the game-making excitement had been nurtured a bit earlier I think I would have started making games sooner. You need some kind of aspirational figure, or someone who's excited about the prospect of it - or at least, that's what I needed and I didn't have it. It was only recently when I became a bit jaded about working in TV and film that I realised games was what I really in my gut wanted to do.""Are there aspirational male developers for guys to look up to? Do all male game devs go into the industry looking up to and trying to become living meme Todd Howard? Reading through this it seems like this person is needlessly gendering the first issue they bring up, in reality I don't think that there are any significant paragon developer figures we can all look up to. More than that, if you're citing a group of career advisors who likely have no experience with gaming but watch TV and movies like it's a religion, no wonder they aren't advising that you go into games. It may even be coming from a place of love, they see TV and movie people making millions, but couldn't even name a development studio, let alone specific dev.Then, of course, the gamedrop:>""A lot of the challenges come from the online space. When things like Gamergate bleed into the mainstream consciousness, it's not going to do much to reinform the public or aspiring developers about what the industry is like,"" she says. ""And that's a shame because I really have met so many creative and progressive individuals and organisations from my short time in the games industry.""Her direct quote is interesting, a generous interpretation may hold that she regrets what the media made of GG, because she's met supportive and nice people on the inside. Her later quotes argue for greater but do so in a relatively sane way, so it could be.The article goes into her game a bit. It is evidently ten minutes long, but is a to the games Ico and Inside, the film Paths of Glory, and the German TV show Generation of War? How do you manage that many in a ten minute game?Some literal unconscious character is central to a concept Fernandez was interested in: creating an emotional attachment between the player and the 'tool' used to solve puzzles (in this case, a human body).She shows some remarkable sanity regarding how she thinks greater representation should be achieved:>""One thing that I really want to stress is that I don't think the solution is to police or censor violent or sexual depictions of women in games. To me, it's about creating a bigger variety of female instead of just repeatedly falling back on character tropes. It's in everyone's best interest. We'll have far more interesting games as a result.Again, a generous interpretation would be that she wants to make her own games with new female characters, our over at will appreciate that approach I think.Then some of the facts regarding the Battlefield V fiasco, and this gem:>""It's intimidating,"" she admits, ""but it's more important to me to make stories I'm interested in with characters I'm interested in, rather than fear this imaginary audience who will probably troll me online at some point in my career anyway.The author of the article is kinda bad, but the dev depicted seems to have her head/PR game on straight.",1

While I think Russia has problems, if you look into Russian geopolitics and their history it's fairly easy to understand where they're coming from and what their motivations are. For example NATO conducts military exercises in Latvia which is right on Russia's doorstep. The US has put defensive missiles in Romania and as Putin pointed out, 'what's the difference between a defensive missile and an offensive missile? It's just the Russia and the Warsaw pact was still a thing, imagine if they managed to slowly get Central American countries into the Warsaw pact. Then they start conducting military exercises in Mexico. That'd be quite alarming for people living in America and would put them on edge.The Cold War ended in the early 90's and the USA has acted as if it never went away. Russians are merely trying to preserve their security which includes having buffer states.

If you do not report it then it is YOUR fault the rapest doesn't get justice. Also all accusations without definitive proof should be looked at as false untill a thorough investigation is done. The accusations that have only dna and victim testimony as proof should result in both the victim and the accuser being put in lockup while a investigation is done. The victim and suspect should be cross examined Multiple times. This entire investigation should be private period. Any breach of that should result in harsh the penalty for false accusations should be considered a felony and carry at least 2/3s of a rapest sentence.,1

Look at your NO ONE ever learns the language of the country they intend to ~~invade~~ move to! No one does that so don't rag on them about it.So what if local children get less time with teachers because foreign kids need additional help since they don't understand the language? Don't you realize just how hard it is to learn the local language when you isolate yourself in communities that don't speak it and have wildly different cultural ideals than the host country?!?

"> However, GOG’s claim that its latest controversial tweet was a mistake is questionable. Jumping on this hashtag, one reserved for discussion regarding the Trump potential plans to strip away trans rights, is seen as more than just a marketing tool by those who hold anti-LGBT opinions. It’s seen as a dog-whistle for their regressive views, intended to undermine #WontBeErased and this new threat to trans US citizens. But it’s just a tweet, right? For those who aren’t directly affected by the plans outlined in the Trump memo, then yeah, it can be perceived as “just a tweet.” However, for LGBT gamers who are affected by news like this, GOG signaling to those who don’t want them to exist is much more than a tweet. Whether intentional on GOG’s behalf or not, it’s seen as an admission of the company’s political leanings. And, like the CD Projekt Red tweet before it, these leanings can be perceived as anti-trans.I don't even know where to start.

"Freelancer was Chris's baby, his magnum opus, his big dream. It was 18 months late on release and that was only because Microsoft removed Chris from production management and put more effective managers in charge. It released with most of its major promised features either scaled down or stripped entirely, not even having proper 6DoF movement which was already standard for both contemporary free body and flight models. Plus it was so far over budget Chris had to sell his studio to Microsoft where it was stripped of IP and developer assets then is Chris's MO. Wasteful development that breaks its own successes so often that for every five steps forward it takes four steps back. Rather than creating a base mechanical system and then expanding on it, SC now has a hundred modular expansions but the core it in flux and every time it changes all of those modules need reworking. The dev itself is very good at keeping details from the public, but thanks to Star Marine being sent to a third party we know why it died. SIG provided what they claimed was a near final copy of the game engine, some years into development, and the module was built off that.... But of course the core was nowhere near competed so after doing a ton of work getting it sorted Foundry 42 handed back their version and found it was completely incompatible with the game engine SC had moved into by that time. Then, shortly after, SC moved to an entirely different game engine altogether. So the Star Marine module was entirely rebuilt. - for those of you keeping track at home, that means the module was scratch built three times before partial Alpha release, and needs constant work to keep it functional without adding new features or content even now.Chris is currently on a yearly salary of over $900,000, more than even EA's CEO, he has multiple family members on the payroll for a total of over $3 million.... In perspective his families total salary earnings to date are over $20million according to their tax returns. You could develop a solid AAA-level game for that if you start with a functional engine. Is it any wonder people think there's a personal motivation to sell jpegs? That being said, I personally think it's worse than just a simple scam. I think Chris has started to believe his own bullshit, reinforced by the fan base, and doesn't realise he's a great visionary but a shit-tier manager.Now come at me with all your best down votes you StarTards.

"""men are less likely to seek help...""This is true. But now ask yourself ""why."" In the first place, men don't want to bother other people with their problems. And that's a sublime attribute. If you can do it do it. Don't bother other people. But sometimes men run out of options. So who's there to break their fall? Women? lol...no. One woman studied the issue for ten years and reluctantly came to the conclusion that women are...""the patriarchy!"" >What Brown also discovered in the course of her research is that, contrary to her early assumptions, men's shame is not primarily inflicted by other men. Instead, it is the women in their lives who tend to be repelled when men show the chinks in their armor.>""Most women pledge allegiance to this idea that women can explore their emotions, break down, fall apart—and it's healthy,"" Brown said. ""But guys are not allowed to fall apart."" Ironically, she explained, men are often pressured to open up and talk about their feelings, and they are criticized for being emotionally walled-off; but if they get too real, they are met with revulsion. She recalled the first time she realized that she had been complicit in the shaming: ""Holy Shit!"" she said. ""I am the patriarchy!"" that's pretty troubling. Does that mean we can't count on women at all? No it doesn't: if we're lucky we can count on our mothers, our sisters, and our female friends. Women are actually good at this sort of thing. But you know what? Don't go crying to your girlfriend, because your ""SO"" wants you to be a rock. That's women. They talk about toxic masculinity, but they don't mean it. Ironically, our male buddies are probably the best people to discuss problems with. You may be surprised just how supportive your male buddies are. :)",1

"I wouldn't say he has a strong case. PayPal is a business and can choose who to do business with, so long as they aren't making that determination based on a protected class (race, gender, etc). No business is obligated to offer services to someone with whose views they don't agree, and though I would prefer this not apply to payment providers (whose only service is moving money around), unfortunately it does.The Unruh Civil Rights Act they cite makes no mention of political affiliation. It specifically outlaws discrimination based on sex, race, color, religion, ancestry, national origin, mental or physical disability, age or medical condition (including HIV status). HOWEVER (and this is what Jones is banking on) the California Supreme Court has held that the protections of the Unruh Act are not restricted to these being said, extending its protection to cover what can be characterized as conspiracy theories and related nonsense is going to be a really hard sell. If Paypal was discriminating against a guy for his choice of political candidate, maybe.

"Uh... Hunting in this game? I find tracking thr legendary animals much more fun because there's no way to fuck up the pelt quality. You can just dumb as many shotgun shells as you like in the cunt and the pelt will be just top tits. Standard hunting? You gotta find the animal. Then study it. If it's skinny or sick or too young, no matter how well you do it'll give you a shitty pelt so don't bother, find another that's healthy and old enough. Then you've gotta shoot it, once, with the right arrow, and make sure the first shot is either an instant kill of a kill, because if you shoot it so it won't die straight away you'll fuck up the quality of the pelt or worse, it'll run so far before it dies you'll lose it in the chase. Then you'll get a perfect pelt.Then you got to finish hunting, and get to town quick enough that rot doesn't set in t the carcass (because selling the carcass is what you really want, fuck donating to the camp, I'll just pay for camp upgrades out of my own pocket. The camp upgrades are useful don't get me wrong, I'd say donate until you have the right value to upgrade Dutch's tent, then only donate the bare minimum to the NPCs don't bother you. Only donate pelts you need for crafting.) if you don't sell it quick enough it'll rot and the value will be harmed. Fuck it, do the fake fisherman trick. To get provisions in your camp just buy the meat from a fucking butcher. Now I know that sounds like fun to some people, and there's days I'm in the mood for that shit, too. But if it doesn't sound like your kind of thing? You can ignore the hunting mostly. Just shoot birds out of the air every now and then so you can make arrows, because that's kind of your only silent weapon you can carry a lot of ammo for. At least as early in the game and I am. Fishing on the other hand? **Fuck me** this game had good fishing. And just like hunting legendary animals, there's legendary fish to catch. The first chapter *is* boring as fuck.

"In America it will largely come down to a challenge for the first person that doesn't settle with a plea deal. Like with the masturbatory aid bans, which were also predicated on obscenity, it requires a court challenge to overturn obviously prohibitions on 1st amendment speech.Also, to anyone claiming ""muh 10th amendment,"" that only works for powers not already delegated to the people/fed. The 1st amendment, like the 2nd, is largely inviolable and cannot be constrained by state law just because they vote to do it. The states don't have the right to curtail 1st amendment speech that is guaranteed by the Constitution at large. Just because they regularly do, doesn't mean it doesn't also regularly get overturned after lengthy court battles.This is why states like California routinely get slapped by the Supreme Court for gross acts.As a further on this, keep in mind that ""nudie mags"" as a whole were considered illegal in the United States until recently, as far as history is concerned. When you see people say that something is illegal, you have to keep in mind that while the State may find it illegal, it doesn't mean that the court will when forced to examine it. Obscenity laws have been dying a slow death of a million court battles for decades, and no higher court *wants* to rule on something being an obscenity or not, because then they will have to once and for all define what an obscenity is without completely trashing the 1st amendment, a feat that they simply can't do, since the Miller test is the most ambiguous and ill-defined standard applicable.As a passing last time edit, obscenity law reflects possibly the last gasp of moralism in United States common law. The great majority of laws focus on the verifiable parties involved with a dispute, the verifiable harm or offense committed, and the verifiable damage of said acts. There is a lack of passion, or focus on right or wrong, in law. There is only what happened, and the facts about what happened. Only in the resolution of a trial does the depravity of a person's conscience in committing acts sway the punishment of those acts. But obscenity is ill-defined, lacks any victims, cannot be tied to a particular public act, and criminalizes the conscience of the accused. It is only ""wrong"" because others are offended by it. No act of deprivation is tied to its existence, nobody is harmed by its creation or and it can only be illegal because the State is making a moral stand. If anything, the world would be better by removing this topic from the State's hands once and for all.Obscenity law is the SJW's wet dream as created by the extreme right. There is functionally no difference between hate speech as envisioned by the extreme left, and obscenity law as crafted by the extreme right.",1

"Our punitive system is kinda dumb. When an breaks a rule in order to cut costs, the fine needs to be whatever it costs to clean up the mess, then whatever money they saved by doing things wrong, multiplied by the inverse of the odds of getting caught. Example: wrong disposal of hazardous waste: cost of doing it properly :$100k. Cost to clean it up: $400kOdds of getting caught: 1 in 50Total fine: $400k + 50 * $100kOr perhaps since there are presumably 49 other improper disposals to clean where the propagator want caught, that fee should be multiplied too, becoming 50 * ($400k + $100k)The point is that getting caught breaking the law needs to be MUCH more expensive than following the law and also much more expensive than what you're costing the victim. So if I falsely accuse you of a crime that you would get 10 years for, my false accusation penalty should be at least 5x that, so 50 years minimum. If a company sells customer data illegally, we need to calculate the damage it did to the customers, then add to that how much they got paid to do it or how much they made from the same in other ways, then multiply that by the inverse of the odds they would get caught (thus the more they tried to cover it up, the less likely it would be to get discovered, thus the higher the penalty Once we have those numbers, fining the company that amount would actually be a significant deterrent. If false rape aviation was punished by a year and only caught 10% of the time, on average a false accuser could expect to spend 36 days in jail. Bump that number up to where it ought to be assuming: 10% catch and conviction rate on false accusers, and 15 years for the original rape, gives: 15 years * 10 = 150 years.

That's why they're so obsessed with ""white genocide"". > > Plus, a bunch of them are NEETs and Weeaboos who are actively on the path of laziness and celibacy laid down and glorified by Chinese cartoons.> > China's master plan was to create a male surplus in their country. Then, they'll send over their young men to American public universities to crowd out and outcompete Americans while leeching government funds. Then they'll dominate sexually and create a large percentage of half-Chinese families.

"Mark Hamill is a really good example of how, oftentimes, the man matters far more than the message, which is to say, who you hear something from matters more than what you hear. I, too, openly question some of the views he expresses on twitter, like many of you on this forum. But you know what? it doesn't really matter. It doesn't matter if he and I don't agree on anything with regards to politics, if the man himself is so obviously full of integrity and his views don't really matter, I'll listen to what he has to say. That's the real trick, if its Anita Sarkessian, it doesn't matter what the message is. If she did a video on the long term benefits of flossing, I'd probably skip picking up floss the next time I'm at the drug store and might question the very foundation of dental hygiene as a science. The messenger often matters as much, if not more so, than the message. If Anita says it, I'm not listening, period. If Alexandria promotes something in a campaign stop, I'm going to assume its dumb, stupid and naïve and not give it a serious thought. Those people can't get through to me. If Tim Poole says it, then even if I disagree with it, he has more than enough credibility with me that I'll think about it, do some research and try to figure out where he's coming from. Hamill is one of those guys. I disagree with him on plenty, but he has a lot of credibility with me. The man is what gets people to pay attention and consider new ideas, the man often matters more than the message.",1

"Shale oil's expensive to produce, so they went wild back when the price was over $90/bbl. Shale oil wells peter out VERY QUICKLY compared to crude. Like, in 5-10 years compared to a heavy crude well which should last 20-30. Meaning you have to keep drilling expensive shale oil wells for very short-term gains, and shale oil's the only reason the US suddenly became a net exporter in the last decade or Saudis know this and American shale oil is the reason they first tried to drive the price up (to punish the US, as it was still a net importer) and then crater the price (to punish them for exporting). The result is that any upward movement in price benefited American companies more than the Saudis, and any threat to cut production meant that American shale oil could fill the gap at a very nice price. The side effects of this was the obliteration of Venezuela's oil-based economy and a serious fuck you to Russia's petro industry. &#x200B;The shale oil crash is gonna make parts of the Dakotas look like Alberta after Trudeau sr. was done with us, and if we could get a fucking pipeline built with all these damned envirotards running around we'd be a great position to satisfy American demand instead of having them buy Saudi oil and thus fund further global terrorism.

Warm climate + rain = bacteria, meat spoils quicker. Spices act as an antiseptic. Keep food fresher longer. Protect from harmful bacteria. You know how Russians pickle Same reason, except in their cases it's the cold winters that make them do this. Gotta have some way of preserving the vegetables. European cuisine didn't mix spices too much, it usually picked just one kind and added it a little bit to preserve the original flavor. Cultures like India added them in abundance, which resulted in an explosion of flavors. And honestly? Taste is subjective. It's just food. You eat it and then poop it out. Stop treating it like some sacred thing. Enjoy that sushi burrito, put sugar in your macaroni. You're not ""ruining it"", you're discovering new flavor God, did Ratatouille not teach you anything?",1

"You know what annoys me about this. It's not the weird ""not oppressed enough"" vibe, it's that their argument doesn't actually make sense.So they start with a number of LGBT individuals saying how they're ""just like you"". They also have a bunch of other unrelated traits that SJWs don't like, just to make sure that you know to hate them.Then they present a bunch of supposed to the idea that pushing ""we're just like you"" is bad, but their are A woman complaining that she accused of having kids for welfare. I assume because she's black. I was under the impression that the 'B' in LGBT stood for 'bisexual', not 'black', shows what I know!2. A woman complaining about being harassed and arrested on the suspicion of being a sex worker. It's not clear why from the avatar though, but I'm guessing she's supposed to be South-East Asian? Either way, I'm not sure what the point is. Racism is bad, but what does that have to do with LGBT people?3. Homeless woman(?) complains that their sexuality bars them from shelters. Giving them the benefit of the doubt that this is a real problem, it is actually relevant. What I'm failing to see is how that demonstrates a problem with ""just like you"" messaging. Surely if the people running these shelters understood that being gay wasn't really a big deal, they'd let this person in. Also this homeless woman has autism, that isn't actually relevant, but they pretend it is.4. Immigrant from ???, at least that's what I assume. Ignoring the weird ""gender variant culture"" stuff, I'm not really sure what the issue is here, again. Colonialism was bad. Racism against immigrants is also bad. How is this an LGBT issue?5. Victim of the War on Drugs. I'm guessing orphaned after the Houston Heroin Bombings of 2004. Seriously though, the war of drugs is bad and has had a lot of collateral damage. Again, how is this an LGBT issue?6. Wheelchair user complaining about the world being inaccessible to them. Fair enough, I guess. I'm not physically disabled, so I don't know how bad it is for them, but it doesn't matter because it's *not an LGBT issue*.So 6 examples and only one is clearly relevant (and even then includes some irrelevant stuff). None actually demonstrate the problem with ""we're just like you"" messaging though. Racism is bad, sexism is bad, ableism is bad, but none of those are problems that are relevant for the LGBT community.",1

"Ok so this is really weirdThe entire thing about the norwegian flag = Nazi flag thing originates from Germany and east Europe from *after* WW2 as a way for skinheads to get around the 'no Nazi imagery' law a lot of those countries have. Thing is, it's a *very* European thing. Even to someone living in Norway, it's not normally a thing a ton of people know. I only know about this because of the time my German friend had a party with a few family members from Germany and had a birthday cake which, in the grand norwegian tradition, had a shitton of norwegain flags on it (which raised *a lot* of eyebrows from the Germans there).So why is this to know the second meaning of the norwegian flag, you need to be either A) from certain parts of Europe or B) be familiar enough with German laws and skinheads to know about how they get around the ""don't wave around a fucking swastika you cunt"" law. And in either situation it would be bizzare that this person would not know *that it's also the fucking norwegian flag* as in A) I would hope someone in Europe would at least vaugely remember the vexiology of their own continent and in B) the use of that flag makes absolutely no sense without any context regarding Norway and Vikings and all thatAlso that's less of a halfway house and more of a ""nearly completely and just waiting for the jury to say I'm good"" house.",1

But the country as a whole? Could be fun. Going guerilla style against far more advanced foes tends to be limited to more sci-fi foes, but having to deal with a modern american military as some middle eastern or what have you could be if pulled off well. Throw in the capacity to use more terroristic actions like hostages as practically a necessity to survive against far more well-armed foes.

Yet I saw men in here who allowed their hate for one person to actually be ok with someone's life being destroyed based on a 30 year old memory with zero coming from anywhere.How men are being treated in the media, the biased judicial system, hiring quotas etc are all way more important than who you support a female who works in a male dominated industry, quotas can be dangerous and if unqualified people are being hired due to their vaginas, people can and will die.Sorry to rant, but hugs to you all. You aren't in this alone. There are a ton of us women who legitimately see what is happening and we don't like it either. So we are spreading awareness and speaking up any chance we get. Third wave feminism has set women back decades in terms of equal treatment and gives us victim status while demonizing all men as those who have made us such.Sorry ladies. I am not a victim.

"I chose the gender option on my PGCE course as I'm a computer science teacher it seemed like an important topic with all that goes on in computing industry and there is a significant gender difference at the GCSE level (girls make up around 20% of the cohort). One of the things i found hardest about this topic was finding any fucking evidence to support any of the claims that were being banded around. So many of the papers i read seemed to consist of them waffling on a lot, citing each other, and not actually producing any sort of data. Some of the data was blatently cherry picked, some didn't even support the claims that the paper was claiming they found the whole thing a complete waste of my life, i scraped a pass. The thing that pissed me off the most though was talking to one of the others on the course who bashed out his assignment over a weekend, found some vague sources which supported what he was saying for references and got just short of the top mark bracket for it. I'd spent the best part of 6 weeks of my life when i wasn't on placement, reading papers and writing my own. a lot of them are still on my kindle from where i sent copies to it to read on the commute. In case anyone is curious, my conclusion is that the industry having a slightly higher ratio of females in tech jobs, than the ratio of university graduates, which in turn is slightly higher then the ratio of university applicants, which is compariable to girls taking the lower education levels indicates that there is no on the basis of gender, at least not at the industry level (individual companies may do, but its not a general trend) and if anything the numbers more indicate the industry making efforts to recruit and retain talented women where it could find them. This was supported by anecdotal evidence from recruitment companies who basically said skill women who could prove it could dictate their salaries and by the study which showed women have a 2 to 1 hiring advantage in stem subjects. I found a single study indicating that at the primary school level, girls and boys have a similar level of interest in technology (i think it was Finnish, which was apparent a mark against me, despite the fact i couldn't find any uk ones). Which by the time they are 14 has deminished to the point where they don't choose computing as an option. Despite the investment of huge amounts of resources, there has been no noticable change to girls taking up the subject. I was unable to find any data indicating at what point they lose it or why girls lose interest in technology, but felt that more research needs to be done on the 11 to 14 year old age bracket to investigate this trend.",1

The % of women in that group is higher than the % of women who are living on the street, so when you combine both into one ""homeless"" stat, it makes it appear like homelessness is more equal between men and women, when in reality it is just an obscuring of the data and a way to smokescreen the very real problems homeless men face.",1

Never mind how Japanese people loved the Scarlett Johansson film or that many in Japan itself still see samurai as heroes and historical symbols, among others.

It doesn't matter if they're ""far right"" or ""far left"" - no matter what views they hold, the EXTREMISM is the issue, not the values they believe that they hold dear.> In the future, when you find yourself starting to do what you have quite literally become famous for doing - take a step back, breathe a little bit, and come back a little bit more calm. People aren't as evil as you try to make them out to be.> Further thoughts: Honestly I believe that both sides of the issue is nothing more than a dick stroking contest to see who is ""morally superior"" - I'll give you a little hint: no one is! Not when you act like THAT, anyway! And also - you attacked someone who is VERY much against extreme religious crap that a lot of people try to pull - and who could've been an ally and an advocate for you on this issue - but instead of trying to see from his you forced him on the defensive immediately and lost him completely on the issue. When you do that, you're not helping your cause at all - you're pushing people AWAY from it. You're being belligerent for no real reason, and in the end, it hurts your issue more than it helps it.Well put. Arctangent kept calling everyone who disagreed with itself ""giant pieces of shit"", which is since that told me it was the bigger piece of shit.",1

"I think one of the big things is that feminist types want to see only fantasy that makes them feel good about themselves, while me (and I assume a bunch of others) want to experience stories. Flawed characters who hit close to home may not always make you feel good about yourself, but they make you think, they give you more than just the creator trying to flatter the idealised self you imagined for yourself. Now many of these people say things like ""so you can believe dragons and not muh but they don't understand that it's different. We need to connect to the characters and honestly, a lot of the time people connect to others because they understand their pain. My example is Harry Dresden, because I am a huge fan and know my shit. So. Many feminists hate his character. But here is the thing, I connect t him because I am similar. Sure, he is a man, a wizard and detective, I'm a woman, trainee at a dental lab and generally a pussy when it comes to physical danger. But he makes fun of himself, like me, he has this huge sense of justice, like me, he gets in trouble because he can not just bend the knee and spit on his morals, like me. The pitfalls of this character are similar to my own problems, just amped up and with magic. I could get him. I do not say you all need to be like him or me. But I can feel a sort of fictional Not trying to make it sound like I am some brilliant person, I am not. But when I participate in the stories of Harry Dresden I have to look at myself from an outside perspective and I have to acknowledge our shared flaws.

"Rule 3 summary, because the mandates it and we do what the says: Star Trek discovery is in a bad place. Its in the same sort of a place as a highly touted first round draft pick of your favorite sports franchise is after the GM and the Coach who drafted him have gotten fired. Think Current Lakers' Head Coach / Dead Man Walking Luke Walton. The sign-up numbers for CBS all-access are bad. They went down after STD came out (according to an by the video in the OP). My Comic Book Store Guy is fond of saying this about digital comics. For over a decade now, everyone in comics has been told that digital is the wave of the future and that paper and ink don't have long to live. Yet, every single month, the digital outlets call my CBSG and try to convince him to hawk their products. As my CBSG is fond of saying, if you don't know what the numbers are for digital comic sales (and no one does) that means they're bad, because if they were good, you would never hear the end of it and those sales numbers would be highly publicized. If you're not hearing CBS talk at great length about exactly how strong CBS all-access growth is, that means the numbers are dismal, because if the numbers were good, they would never stop talking about it. Now, it appears the first five episodes of STD season 2 went way over budget, because what was screened was received horribly and reshoots were ordered. Think Justice League, think Solo: A star wars story. Now, Les Moonves, who was the champion of STD at CBS, and those who are loyal to him on the board, are out. CBS can cancel STD and Moonves takes the entire blame, and the new board gets to write it off. The leadership that backed STD being gone removes the Sunk Cost Fallacy for eliminating this piece of trash. The new Picard series (which I'm not yet sure how I feel about) being provides a replacement The shorts were made to be sold to as a way to generate some cash to cover STD's losses. Netflix has not liked the performance they got from STD season 1, and they are not backing season 2. They made the shorts, and no one wanted them, much like no one asked for STD in the first place. Everything about STD rubbed me the wrong way from the very start, I'm glad its on life support and I'm glad it will soon be cancelled.",1

You could maybe make case of SEED's ZAFT being such a case due to taking heavy inspiration from MSG Zeon but it also have some differences that make such claims harder to make. Gundam X's Space Revolutionary Army could be stretched to maybe fit due to again taking inspiration from Zeon but the series don't really focus much time on that faction so it's hard to know.I don't think you find such state in G, Wing, Turn A or 00, maybe cases could be made for AGE, Reconguista in G or Iron-Blooded Orphans I haven't completed them so I don't know but even if so that still plenty of series that lack such states which makes saying ""almost always"" a bit much.>Legend of the Galactic Heroes, a Japanese novel series adapted into multiple anime shows, also contains a similar government called the Galactic Empire.I wouldn't say the Galactic Empire is primarily inspired by a WWII-era Germany but rather 19 century Prussia or the German Empire with the focus on how important nobility is to advance in the ranks of the Galactic Empire. >Hetalia: Axis Powers portrays a group of countries with a sympathetic, Germany as the main character.

"This is something that echoes a bit with me as you see the same thing between tech industry and science. Employers love to write off long work days to be something proud about but to me it's really exploitable and just a deep flaw of various cultures (it's a global phenomenon, really). On reddit, far too often when I warn peope to not simply accept working 60+ hours on a 40h a week contract, they get very defensive and claim everyone else is lazy.The 40h/week standard is that way for a good reason. You need a healthy work-life balance. You will likely be busy enough just having a household and aside from that your brain and body need to rest. To push your body beyond without receiving extra payment and the choice to refuse is But it not this way, especially not for startups in science and tech both and also academic positions, already starting at the PhD level. Hell, I too am expecting to graduate with my doctorate in a little over a month, but I for sure had 50-60h on average for a 40h a week contract. It is the norm despite seemingly scamtastic. Two things need to happen: we need to stop glorifying destroying yourself physically and mentally for the pockets of your employer and people need to unionize more or start getting more with programs which protect worker's rights. Germany has good unions, but the same cannot be said of france, NL and the US. And especially for you americans out there: I as a european cannot believe that you can find work without having a legal contract! Making it mandatory to have a contract should be the first step in making things better. A contract is not there to limit you. It is a way to protect your rights and prevent your employer from exploiting you. You have a legal document you can at all times refer back to and nobody can debate it. In france (and I think NL too) at the very least for overtime you are obliged to be paid extra. People I know let me know that sometimes they are send home after their 8h shift is over purely due to the fact that the employer does not want to pay them more. Edit: Due to some comments on this: Of couse it's very reasonable to have a crunch busy period and expect to work a lot, then have periods where you are not busy at all. I am not saying we shouldn't ever have crunch periods. However, we should avoid them when we can and not encourage employers to chronically understaff because they know they can get away with long term giving people 60h work weeks on 40h contracts.",1

">The project involves studying female engineering professors to ""lend critical insights into the divide"" that results in fewer women entering science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) programs.STEM field subjects don't appeal to women at a base level, and don't appeal to the vast majority of the general public at that same base level. This is because they require a level of scholastic preparation and understanding that is far above what the average person desires to spend, to the point that people who enjoy them consistently showcase similar symptoms to autism. There, I saved you half a mil; the NSF should've sent the check to me.Seriously, the verdict on the 'Women in STEM' argument has been available for years now, and the bottom line is that STEM shit just doesn't appeal to the vast majority of people, including the vast majority of women. It's hours upon hours of memorizing formulas and rote material, constant testing to ensure knowledge retention, and repetition ad infinitum. Yeah, anyone can go into STEM and learn it, but as someone part of it, while I would like to see more of anyone in the club, the journey fucking sucks. If you want more people in STEM, the education methodology needs to be rebuilt from the ground up, starting with Mathematics as it's the ultimate framework for the rest of the group, and then moving on from there. Good luck, however, getting old hats to change what clearly works in favor of appeasing the up-and-comers who tend to be self-centered and lazy.>The study seeks to upend current engineering and computer science programs by educating students and faculty on the ""benefits of diversity and required to foster welcoming environments for women.""Then this is not a study. A study collects and analyzes data, that's it. It isn't designed to push changes on its own; such action is supposed to be for those who wish to interpret the data that way. It's almost like this anthropologist is barely a legitimate professor and has no idea what her job is supposed to be (hint: it's not forcing personal ideologies on others for the sake of being able to give yourself a back-pat).>Due to the prominence and impact of ECS [engineering and computer science], identifying gender inequities in the field and interrupting them will help welcome and retain more talented women from a range of intersectional identitiesThe assumption that all women are talented, because that is what is being implied here, is beyond retarded and speaks to the general societal sentiment that too many people have been coddled into thinking they are This just in: you don't. Nobody matters until they make the personal decision to leave behind some kind of legacy. Such a thing is not a 'given', it's an 'earned', and had these people had parents who pushed them to compete via some means, they would've learned vectors of gender.""What an hilarious statement. Not only does this just sound ridiculous when you read it, because it's obviously the result of a stupid person using big words to sound intelligent, but anyone who has a decent vocabulary knows that the term 'vector' relates to pathogens and disease transmission, resulting in a statement that rounds down to 'intersecting diseases of gender'.>If anything, at least they aren't giving a lot of money for someone to study so... that's an improvement I guess?Perhaps, but the organization is still pissing away over half a million dollary-doos that's going to result in a highly-biased result that is woefully inadequate, confusing to parse, and rushed. What would have been a better expenditure would've been to host some sort of scholarship contest for kids entering into college involving some research project, where said students would have to produce a finalized report and analysis (properly supervised, of course). That way, you immediately separate the wheat from the chaff and find out not only who wants to go to college for STEM, but you also give young kids an exposure to real academic work to see if they want to actual make a career out of studying and testing. This gives them a chance to test the waters, rather than forcing them to make the decision in the middle of their transition and far more difficult undergraduate course work or, god forbid, at the start of their graduate course work because the college they went to didn't have enough funding to start proper academic research projects for undergrads.Or, shit, just donate it to an up-and-coming or buy a bunch of supplies and auction them off to programs that need them. Fuck, anything would be better than giving money that belongs to the sciences to a fucking humanities professor that unironically teaches shit like 'Queer Anthropology', as if the ancient human races spent any time coming up with statements like, 'Hmm, I woke up on the left side of the bed today, so I guess I'm a demi-gender pan-deersexual who has a penis, but that's hidden inside me and manifests itself via a vagina'.",1

For one, I don't see any more a ""hospitality organizer"" than I see my email provider: they provide a service by which I may communicate with others. The standards I use to communicate with friends are vastly different than those I use for business contacts, and I neither expect nor desire those standards to be enforced by the email these providers [already see themselves as politically neutral]( and focused on tone, so following those guidelines just gives us more of the same. And of course tone itself isn't politically neutral: see the censoring of the legal term [""illegal aliens""]( (though to their credit they appear to have backed off on that decision). Or the infamous ""gender pronouns"" debate. If I call a M2F transgender person ""he"", is that ""tone"" (and subject to censorship), ""political"" (and not subject to censorship), or a giant grey area subject to the whims of the censor and how they feel about me and/or the subject on any given day?Thirdly, being transparent about why you'e censoring someone doesn't really help the person being censored that much. We know exactly why The Daily Stormer was deplatformed: the GoDaddy CEO woke up one day and said ""I hate these guys and want them off my site"". When Alex Jones was deplatformed there were news articles and official statements on standby to tell us why it happened. When has such transparency ever answered more questions than it raised? You're still trying to polish the turd that is highly subjective standards with the shine of ""policy"" and what if I don't want these platforms to ""police tone""? So far they have a shit track record in policing their platforms; why should I trust them in the future? Earlier the presentation poses the question ""by what right do you do this?"". They try to answer it by saying ""well we'll only focus on tone"", but the question remains: ""by what right are you the arbiter of if there is a problem with ""tone"", why enforce a top-down, one size fits all approach to it? Why not empower the users with more advanced tools to filter things themselves (or for others with their consent) without removing the ""offensive"" material from the platform.

"No Nut November has recently begun, and I'm sure many of you reading are along with myself. In the years past I have been hailed as a champion - for 7 straight years I have spent November as a chastitised christian. I hoped to continue this legacy. And last night, I failed.One as regal as I, failing? Impossible. Only the gods could achieve such power to stop me. I guess that night I was dealing with a god.I'm on the YouTube homepage, trying to find some epic Morgz videos, when I stumble upon a certain video. This damn video. Its bright thumbnail, its captivating title - it utterly fascinated me. This cursed video: it was none other than “Fortnite's most EPIC event EVER!”, posted by the one and only Ali A.My body immediately began to shake, and my penis shot straight up. The most EPIC event EVER? What could it be? I felt a pull towards the video like I had never felt before. It took me awhile to realize the effect the video was having on me. I fell back in my chair in fear. In agony. In complete and utter despair.My hand grabbed the mouse and began to slowly slide over to the thumbnail. I kicked and screamed and cried, trying and failing to stop my body. Sweat was dripping down my entire body. Minutes later, the pointer had finally reached its And with a cry, the hand that didn't feel like mine anymore clicked.I was immediately met with a scream. “THIS IS IT LADIES AND GENTLEMEN!” Purple light streamed from the computer monitor and began to fill the room. The voice on the screen continued talking, seemingly in an ancient tongue. My entire body began to quiver as something awakened inside of me. My speakers began to shake as something inside of them grew louder. Was this music? Or was this something else?The music finally picked up, and as Ali's intro began, I came harder and faster than I ever had before. The sensation rendered me The last thing I remember seeing that night was my cum streaked over his face. And it looked like he was smiling.I woke up to a rising sun. My clothes were back on, my sweat was wiped away, and my penis was flaccid. I could finally see again. Was this all a dream? No, there’s no way. It felt too real.My suspicions were immediately crushed as I looked to the monitor. In a drunk stupor, it looks like I had changed my desktop background to a picture of him. He was staring into my heart - into my soul. And he was covered in my cum.So, guys, whatever you do, don’t watch Ali A's newest video. Anybody less powerful than I would surely be dead.

"Someone debunked this guy - and it was Cecilia? What timeline is this?> Picciolini, who describes himself as a “former white supremacist leader,” came onto Kotaku’s radar in July, when he hosted a Reddit AMA. In it, he claimed that right-wing extremists go into multiplayer games to recruit vulnerable demographics into their cause. Intrigued, my colleague Kashmir Hill and I reached out to Picciolini to hear more. We were curious about the right-wing movers and shakers who could fit an entire political pitch into a Fortnite match.> When we asked Picciolini for evidence of his claim and an interview, he referred us to “the many who have experienced the recruitment” and attached a few screenshots of Nazi imagery in open world games like All Points Bulletin. He also forwarded a screenshot of the game Active Shooter, a school shooting simulator, which was pulled from Steam before its release. Another screenshot was from a YouTube video titled “Fag Jews” in which someone named AuTiSmGaMiNg played Call of Duty. It had 11 views.> It’s hard to imagine that the blustering Picciolini has seen enough to make up for the NPR author’s otherwise sparse evidence, and if you have spent any time in an online multiplayer game, you know that some player-made digital swastika is as likely a product of some 12-year-old edgelords as it is of neo-Nazi propagandists seeking to turn the teens to their side. This leads to basic questions: Were any victims of the alleged conversion tactics interviewed? Any recruiters? If this is happening on a large scale, why haven’t any games especially ones who spend countless hours each week playing online games—caught a whiff of this wild thing and reported on it?> NPR’s sources, at least as laid out in their report, simply do not provide adequate support for the claim that white supremacists are actively recruiting gamers on multiplayer games on a scale broad enough for anyone to be concerned about it. And to take it a step further, mainstream media publications claiming a clear pipeline between gamers and far-right extremists are buckling into a trope in normie games coverage that simply needs to end if anyone is going to responsibly cover the increasingly established gaming community: parental as journalism. It’s what turned the mainstream conversation around video game addiction into a hot-take circus of bad research and even worse interviewing tactics. It’s what’s completely distorted the scientific methods toward understanding whether violent games make kids more violent. And it’s the sort of thing that, in the ‘80s, led suburban parents to question whether their Dungeons & teens were literal Satanists.> The NPR story’s author, who is a mother of two, wrote a book this year titled The Art of Screen Time: How Your Family Can Balance Digital Media and Real Life. Reached out to for comment, she did not respond. When I asked Picciolini why he feels confident stating that there is a pipeline between gamers and far-right extremists, he said this:>> “I receive emails or calls weekly from parents concerned that their young sons are beginning to use language aligned with alt-right and white nationalist ideologies, narratives denying the Holocaust or defaming Jews, discussing conspiracy theories related to George Soros. Parents tell me time and time again that they believe that they are being influenced while playing multiplayer video games by other people participating in those games. It begins by using language like “f*ggot” and “n*gger” to desensitize them, followed by memes, then young people beging [sic] to parrot the words until they are led to forums on gaming sites or 4chan and 8chan.”Bets on her getting screaming SJWs in her mentions today?",1

"Ah. Time for history:After Batista was overthrown there was a serious hunt for everyone who supported him. The fate of those who were reported to have supported Batista was pretty simple:From [wikipedia]( >A notable example of revolutionary justice occurred after the capture of Santiago, where Raúl Castro directed the execution of more than seventy Batista as is often the way during such witchhunts, many people who had done nothing wrong were soon being after taking power, Castro also created a revolutionary militia to expand his power base among the former rebels and the supportive population. Castro also created the informant Committees for the Defense of the Revolution (CDRs) in late September 1960. Local CDRs were tasked with keeping ""vigilance against activity"", keeping a detailed record of each neighborhood's inhabitants' spending habits, level of contact with foreigners, work and education history, and any ""suspicious"" behavior.

So then they give a bunch of incentives for Canadians to switch into the industry, a bunch of training programs spring up which barely have anything to do with the actual work in the industry causing a bunch of Canadians to switch careers for something better. Meanwhile, the government also starts importing qualified workers which combines with the flood of graduates to depress wages in the industry at the lower levels.

This is after saying on multiple occasions while they were developing Origins that they were ""staying out of the original Star Control universe so that hopefully Fred & Paul (the original devs) can make a true sequel some day"" or something to that effect.A lot of us Star Control fans were really excited that Stardock was going to be making a Star Control game, and we were *doubly* excited when Fred & Paul announced they were going to make a true sequel. At this point now (contrary to what Brad and his cronies are claiming), Fred & Paul can't even *start* working on their true sequel because they've got this lawsuit hanging over their head, and the settlement offer from Stardock says outright that they're literally never allowed to make another Star Control game again as long as they live.If Star Control: Origins is being review bombed, I can essentially guarantee you that that's the reason. The vast majority of the fan community would like to see both Star Control games, and many of us decided not to purchase Origins because of this ridiculous lawsuit*.",1
"Easily the biggest piece of shit writing about games today. Unsurpringly, the article is poorly-written and full of gems like this kind of well-meaning and frequently employed by developers with vocal fanbases—can contribute to the problem.

If even massive companies like Blizzard laud these fans’ outbursts, after all, they must be justified.Is this what they teach in Gender Studies? Or is this one of those deals where he knows he's making this up, but figures if he says it confidently enough people will believe it? And here's a clue, dipshit: This is justified. People don't want this product, and it's being sold to them as if it's something other than a shallow cash grab. It doesn't matter if a proper Diablo game is still being developed; the problem is that they thought so little of their audience that they thought we'd love this. That's a problem.

This is just a situation of a bitter ex wife. For all we know, she may not have wanted to put out for him any more and that lead him to stray. Ladies have to understand that unless there are legitimate health concerns, men want sex. It's a healthy part of a And if a woman denies them that without legitimate cause, then it could be reasonable for divorce or having an affair. Tell a woman that and they will go insane, but it's a simple truth. The same applies to woman as well. I have know girls who cheated on their boyfriends because they would not put out for them. But in these situations, the girls wanted to get pregnant. In any case, I would guess she was bitter before the affair. It is a part of 'empty nest syndrome'.

"> I've read people insisting the Asians vs Harvard case isn't about Affirmative Action. Is that true?Not directly. Indirectly, the reason Asians suffer is because of affirmative action. you could ensure that only white people would suffer from affirmative action, but that would lead to such a decrease in the number of white people that people's eyebrows might start to go up. You can rest assured that the SJWs don't want their own children to have a close to zero chance of getting into top schools. So in practice, if Harvard loses, it's the end for affirmative action - at least in its current form. I am fairly optimistic now that King Kavanaugh is on the court.> In any case, if Affirmative Action is upheld, what about reverse Affirmative Action? Could employers look negatively on applicants who might have benefited from AA?Legally, no. In practice, they may try. This just ends up harming minorities who actually do have merit.

Its bright thumbnail, its captivating title - it utterly fascinated me. This cursed video: it was none other than “Fortnite's most EPIC event EVER!”, posted by the one and only Ali A.My body immediately began to shake, and my penis shot straight up. The most EPIC event EVER? What could it be? I felt a pull towards the video like I had never felt before. It took me awhile to realize the effect the video was having on me. I fell back in my chair in fear. In agony. In complete and utter despair.My hand grabbed the mouse and began to slowly slide over to the thumbnail. I kicked and screamed and cried, trying and failing to stop my body. Sweat was dripping down my entire body. Minutes later, the pointer had finally reached its And with a cry, the hand that didn't feel like mine anymore clicked.I was immediately met with a scream. “THIS IS IT LADIES AND GENTLEMEN!” Purple light streamed from the computer monitor and began to fill the room. The voice on the screen continued talking, seemingly in an ancient tongue. My entire body began to quiver as something awakened inside of me. My speakers began to shake as something inside of them grew louder. Was this music? Or was this something else?The music finally picked up, and as Ali's intro began, I came harder and faster than I ever had before. The sensation rendered me The last thing I remember seeing that night was my cum streaked over his face. And it looked like he was smiling.I woke up to a rising sun. My clothes were back on, my sweat was wiped away, and my penis was flaccid. I could finally see again. Was this all a dream? No, there’s no way. It felt too real.My suspicions were immediately crushed as I looked to the monitor. In a drunk stupor, it looks like I had changed my desktop background to a picture of him. He was staring into my heart - into my soul. And he was covered in my cum.So, guys, whatever you do, don’t watch Ali A's newest video. Anybody less powerful than I would surely be dead. Stay safe this November - deny Fortnite.",1

"Despite having a trans girlfriend, I’ve been lurking meta since I discovered it this spring. I generally agree with most of the viewpoints of the posters here, from gun control, the insanity of the left, the anti illegal immigration sentiments, JT, Pro Bernier, affirmative action, etc. Even on a lot of the trans issues; regardless of how I feel about my gf, i totally get how it’s weird to most people, and I frankly have no issue if you want to call her a man. I mean, it’s an asshole move and lacks grace if you do it to a person’s face, but I won’t hate you for it, I get it (I’m a huge Shapiro fan, and he does not mince words on the subject). Im Pro Jordan Peterson (as is my trans gf)But I will guess that most of the “hate” towards trans people on meta is coming from people who have never actually met or had a with a trans person. Like any segment, there are crazies, and likely a higher percentage than in gen pop, sure. But calling trans people mentally retarded and saying they can’t do a job that has nothing to do with their gender really is pure hate. I would never say you folks don’t have the right to say it, I’m a free speech absolutist, but you do nothing but hurt your side of the political spectrum. Yes, the left is filled with hate at the moment, but you are just continuing the cycle and turning away folks like me who are on board with most things that the PPC party champions. It’s fine to have your opinion, but to have that much hate for people (CANADIANS) you have never met is telling more of you than of them. Not all trans folks are activists trying to change our society, most I have met are actually the opposite; opposed to the activism, they don’t want that spotlight, they just want to lead normal lives. There currently isn’t any that helps trans people as much as actually does, until that time this is in a lot of cases the best course of action for a happier life.I would also like to note, that not all trans people are actually legit gender dysmorphic, I have met a few that are straight up flaming gay dudes that took it too far. You know what that means, being able to tread that line?It’s called nuance, something sorely lacking on both sides. I hate the crazy left, but the vitriol from some here is just as bad. Nay, it’s worse. The left can at least claim their insanity is out of « feelings » and « justice » and « equality ». All you folks have is hateTo the bigots on here",1

"The process for me started with the general snarky tones of games journalists on podcasts. I heard one whine about a co-host using the word crazy and I found it absurd. I also didn't like the dismissive and self centered way they were speaking about the next (current console generation) going all digital as if people who couldn't afford/don't have access to high speed internet were Luddites holding society back. It was very San Francisco elitist. When ME3 occurred I was more on the side of journalists. And I even today I still day expecting Bioaware to change the ending is fully on retarded and no chimping out is going to convince me that outrage mobs should force artists to change their production. Get angry and warn others all you want but demanding a change? It happened, get over it and don't buy the next Bioware game.But out of that incident were reports of people getting on the case of one of the writers and I don't think people should have harassed her but iirc she was sort of flippant and snarky, but all the outlets white knighted cause wamen and that didn't sit well with me. I wasn't at gamergate ground zero so when I heard of it, I immediately dismissed it as a bunch of spergs crying because some game was in 59 fps instead of 60 fps or other such typical gamer nonsense. However by that time I was tired of gaming press becoming more and more adversarial and making more and more petty, disingenuous complaints so I decided to give GG an earnest look. Additionally I started seeing comic pros act u professional and normie fans were applauding while clutching at their pearls because you could see Ms. Marvel's thighs.I also didn't like the way I was see more and more judging history based on the oh so enlightened ideals of today.Some time around this time during a State of the Union President Obama (whom I was a fan of at the time) mentioned the wage gap which didn't sit right. I assumed he wasn't mistaken but I couldn't see how it was legal. And if it's illegal how are these very public companies very publicly getting away with it? From that I saw some Youtube vids of people I wasn't normally interested in, including a 2 hour binge of TL;DR on a road trip.

This idiot is so far up his own asshole he would ostracize half the population. and condemn mindset that men are 100% of the problem is dangerous. Its radical ideologies like this that get people killed. lets face it here people we all know that not all men are pieces of shit. So if the vast majority of people can accept that why cant these fringe group is shitty people everywhere, weather you are politically right wing/ politically left wing. but here's the real kicker even though there's all sorts of really shitty people from all walks of life. and yes this colossal fuck wit in the post is one of takes a truly spiteful, self loathing and shitty person to be able to just blanket entire populations with accusations and paint them with the same brush. and my friends I ask you how long do we allow these toxic cunts to continue this?. im all for freedom of speech. however when it comes to freedom of speech you have to be prepared for the back lash people will give you. &#x200B;this idiot and all the other idiots like him seriously needs to be punched in the face maybe then some sense will be knocked into him. As I said im all for free speech. but just remember everything has a price you may not be incarcerated for saying something super despicable but you may very well get the shit kicked out of you. and honestly I think this guy could benefit from an ass whooping probably by some really tough ladies who are sick of this shit that's just my two cents.",1

"So just to be clear: About 10 million men and teenaged boys died fighting in WW1. The majority of these men didn't have the right to vote, because suffrage in Europe was contingent on property ownership, and most working class men didn't own enough property to be enfranchised. The mountains upon mountains of straight white male corpses propelled the universal suffrage movement to the forefront. Women achieved the vote upon mountains of dead males, both in Europe and the US (see: civil war). Not a single woman had to actually fight for suffrage. She suffered no real risk. She just had to complain to the men in power. And the ""patriarchs"" in government gave women the vote with no conscription obligations (that's not equality, that's chivalry) as soon as the majority said they wanted it. These men and boys, who suffered some of the worst deaths humanly imaginable -- having their guts blown out in trenches and inhaling poison gas, being eaten alive by rats while crucified on barbed wire -- were ""privileged"", according to feminists. A sizable percentage of feminists from the time period actually encouraged men and boys -- who again couldn't vote -- to go die for them in the trenches, to protect female ""honor"" (see white feather campaign). While the suffragists demanded universal suffrage, the suffragettes wanted only rich white women and men to vote. We celebrate the latter, not the former, because the former draw into question feminist mythology [Edit: there were some women from the time period, often described as feminists or who were consistent; eg the American anarchist Emma Goldman (whom I'm quite sure would be appalled by modern feminism) helped mount a legal challenge arguing that conscription was a violation of the 13th Amendment's prohibition against involuntary servitude. The Supreme Court disagreed. Ironically Goldman considered the suffragettes a bunch of spoiled brats, and famously claimed that ""if voting changed anything they'd make it illegal""] Hundreds if not thousands of men were executed on the front lines to prevent desertion, even though historians now agree that many WWI campaigns were useless suicide missions, that the men knew it, and that the ""deserters"" were in the right not to throw their lives away for a patch of mud. In the US, men were imprisoned, tortured and even executed for refusing to fight. These included conscientious objectors from religious groups. (two of these men, Hutterite brothers, were tortured to death at Alcatraz). The majority of American men who fought in WWI were effectively forced to do so. Far more Americans who fought in WWI were conscripted than volunteered. Today, little rich girls who would be living in the gutter without the benefaction of their rich daddies, and living in caves without the benefaction of men as a group, condemn powerless white men and boys from a hundred years ago who died being eaten alive by rats while crying out for their mothers -- because they were white, and male. Yes, this is a perfectly sane society, and feminism is a perfectly sane philosophy. Moreover it encourages ""gender equality."" Honestly, I don't feel hate. I just feel shame and disgust. Shame for what feminism has done to this society, and disgust for both the men and women who have allowed this to happen.",1

Just at the slightest chance to hate on gamers. In case anyone was still wondering what disgusting pile of trash the game ""journalists"" are, there's yet another proof.Notice their MO.

If people argue for socially liberal positions such as - being pro-choice on abortion, legalisation of cannabis, rehabilitation of offenders rather than incarceration/ death penalty, legalisation of gay marriage, racial and gender equality - are they really called ""right wing"" ? Because to me, that statement seems to fly in the face of reality. I would say that people who take those positions are generally referred to as left wing or liberal, particularly by right wing commentators. &#x200B;\>This is further shown by how during the old Culture War, the “left wing” opposed theocracy, whereas today you’ll find zero complaints about Islamic theocracy on today’s official “left” and merely raising the subject is dismissed as racism. &#x200B;This one is very easy to debunk.

"1.) I'm happy that Breitbart managed to get and release this document. 2.) The coverage on Breitbart I checked so far (I did not read all their articles, I only looked at a few) has warped and changed meanings in several places. These are close enough that the sources provided seem to substantiate them, yet if you check the whole manual or look at the evidence provided critically you'll see it's either misleading or false in several 1: Breitbart: Trump, Conspiracy Theorist - [One of the reasons Google identifies for allegedly widespread public with internet free speech is that it “breeds conspiracy theories.”]( context: In [The Good Censor]( this slide is at the end of the section ""What’s the role of the tech firms in all of this?"", with previous slides detailing how tech firms are mismanaging the issues. Under this context the beginning of the slide ""When it comes to users, all of this bad behaviour and and then end ""... breeds conspiracy theories"" has a completely different meaning. Not that internet free speech is breeding conspiracy theories (as Breitbart says), but that the mismanagement of the companies (being intransparent about their algorithms and behavior) breeds such conspiracy stories by removing the ability from people to verify or falsify them easily. (I have to leave now, so only one example for now, I'll edit more in later).3.) In regards to the twitter reply by Bokhari you can see similar methods used. What is said is close to the truth in order to possibly mislead when not accurately checking, but false if you actually do check. One simple example here as well directly in the first tweet: >A few ""centrists"" (who unlike Evil Partisans, are unbiased, non-tribal, always correct and never wrong) have decided The Good Censor is fake news. Ironically, they base this claim on a video that spreads horrendous fake news in its first 5 the ""centrist"" point as /u/psa_sitch pointed out (but which can be forgiven as some centrists retweeted it), this is also a false statement.

"For those who don't know, is the name of an indie film series put out by Zombie Orpheus who are also the producers (I think it's producers) of the ""Gamers"" films (i.e. ""The Gamers"" ""The Gamers: Dorkness Rising"" and ""The Gamers: Hands of Fate""), though I believe they didn't become affiliated with the Gamers movies until the second or third such feature. The actual production company that makes the movies is [Dead Gentlemen Productions]( think. The exact nature of how the two companies are related doesn't seem to be entirely clear (that I can find with some casual *is* clear is that in the last few films, the content that they produce has started to take on SJW overtones. I know some people here [didn't like the last Gamers movie]( because of perceived SJW-isms, something that I [disagreed with]( at the it's gotten worse since then. ""Gamers Zero"" and ""The Gamers: The Shadow Menace"" (the former being a collection of shorts, leading into the latter film) went full-retard in their support for social justice. Several points include:* Magellan, a wizard who comes to Earth from the fantasy world of Fartherall (and promptly gives himself amnesia), unconsciously uses his magic to influence events in the 21st century. These include his causing the housing crash of 2008, coining the ""ethics in game journalism"" line, and encouraging Trump to run for President.* A new group of gamers includes an openly gay fat guy, who objects strongly to playing Rogar as being straight, despite Rogar being an existing character who is firmly established as being heterosexual. This results in Rogar seducing two male guards during a heist.* An Asian female member of that new group angrily objects to a comment someone else makes that she thinks is ""casual misogyny"" (I can't remember what the comment was).* A black guy in the new group is implied to have had a recent encounter with racist members of law enforcement. Because of this, he has Nimble (a white character) openly say (when he meets some enemies during a nighttime encounter) ""Greetings, fellow white people! Isn't it grand that I, as a white man, can encounter you here at night and *not* have my presence be construed as inherently Another member of that group, a white girl who is implied to be a lesbian, gets upset at the idea of The Shadow (the campaign's ultimate enemy) having kidnapped a princess, remarking that the trope was old when Super Mario Bros. did it, and that the princess should rescue herself. (She then has egg all over her face when she's told that ""Princess"" is the name of the five year-old daughter of another member of her party.)In short, the newest productions in the ongoing series (the two series share the same universe) seem to be going full socjus.

The age of the two main characters here are 16 and 15 and this, **correct me if I'm wrong here**, is considered child porn. Although The UK age of consent is 16, The specific issue is that a 16 year old legal is having sexual relations with a 15 year old who is still a “child”, a depiction. that they would not want to stick their 2-inch pole in this deep, troublesome hole. On the other hand, the real issue lies with the stupid laws and provisions that are in place. They are drawings. Fictional characters. They are not real ~~just like your for as long as they're drawn. Just because a creator of a work has labelled characters a certain age that should not mean anything. The laws in UK and the general populace mindset regarding this thing need to change as they still treat drawings as having the same rights as a living, breathing, normal people.

Not mentioning this reflects either gross ignorance or example of an account that almost sums up these Russian troll carries an auto-generated handle and has almost exclusively tweeted disparagingly about The Last Jedi, and engaged in “anti-SJW” rhetoric. In the middle of these tweets, the account all of a sudden tweeted in support of Donald Trump during the latter’s visit to the United Kingdom, which was met with large protests in London. Besides not containing any personal information, having no profile picture and other Russian troll this account only posted 9 tweets in more than a year from its creation in January 2017 to February 2018, all of them regarding a particular Anime series on YouTube. From April 2018 onwards, during the lead-up to the release of The Last Jedi for the home video market, and in anticipation of Solo: A Star Wars Story opening, the account suddenly comes to life and begins tweeting frequently about The Last Jedi, identity politics and Rian Johnson. After the data was collected, the account has been through a “reset” where many of its public tweets have been deleted, leaving only its replies.Gee, I wonder if there's any other demographic besides paid shills for the Russian government who don't care about Twitter enough to bother making a username or uploading a profile picture, value their privacy enough to not upload personal information and to periodically purge tweets, dislike SJWs, like Donald Trump, dislike TLJ, and like anime.>One of the accounts which has now been deleted by Twitter exhibited some of the lingual that researchers have observed in Russian troll tweets. On July 11, tweeted: “So, now explain why Mark Hamil didn't like Luje in TLJ?”. The simplicity and brevity of the language, as well as the fact that this purported Star Wars fan doesn’t spell “Hamill” or “Luke” correctly, are all indicators that raises suspicions. In combination with other handle, lack of personal matter on account etc.), the verbiage suggests that the user may be a Russian troll. The literature suggests that Russian trolls primarily use mobile apps for Twitter posts, and thus auto-correct and word suggestion on smartphones disguise any poor English skills to an extent.J and K are next to each other in the English keyboard layout.

"I disagree with a fundamental premise of this article. The author seems to be under the impression that because gaming journalism is inherently shallow, it attracts people who are essentially well-meaning schlubs with no talent. He doesn't stop to consider that the quality may be shit because it's filled with people who are *malicious*; people who aren't just doing this because they like talking about stuff, but people who fucking hate the thing they cover and want to destroy it.And I'm not sure why he thinks this. Is it because gaming publications are inherently aimed at hobbyists and would thus preclude any advancement into serious fields? If so, he should stop to consider that it isn't 2005; video games are not some thing you do in a basement somewhere. They're a multi-billion dollar industry and so the defense a small hobby has against social climbers is virtually gone. And that's not mentioning how becoming popular within a niche is a well known tactic; it's how the Paul brothers got rich, and Cardi B, and virtually every ""sensation"" since Justin Bieber. Why wouldn't opportunists be lurking around? Why *wouldn't* an industry bigger than movies have people willing to tank their own reputations to destroy it?More to the point, it *is* possible to produce quality content we could describe as ""gaming journalism"". Yeah, rehashing press releases is stupid and but there are people who conduct interviews with developers, mess around with hardware, report on the society and culture surrounding games, (in ways that aren't just polemics against consumers) conduct serious reviews of titles, etc, etc.So I don't think ""game journalism sucks because it's just not possible for it not to suck"" is at all a valid stance to take; it's lazy and ignores the fact that gaming publications hire people who fucking hate video games. This naive view of games journalism still being issues of *Nintendo Power* and shit like is just flat-out wrong.

They're the party of good ideas and civil rights and that means that they have a monopoly on those issues. And that means that everyone not them is the exact opposite -- Stoooooopid rednecks who hate everyone and will never amount to anything. The US is liberal and thanks to Obama, we've entered a liberal golden age and the GOP will have to spend the next 30 years out in the wilderness until they learn how to be DNC-lite.... Wait, what do you mean she lost? Wait, it's Trump? And he's doing a good job? *And half the country agrees with him?* That doesn't make any sense! There MUST be something wrong with the country and reality itself, because lefties *can't be wrong.* 2. At the same time you have them having this mental breakdown due to the world refusing to confirm to their fantasies... You have their reaction being organized protest. Heavily organized protest, to the point of being basically glorified mob actions. And the way the left does this stuff is they synchronize the protests. Very effective... but it makes it hard to ignore the fact that you're all things. Remember when we called them Snowflakes and they got pissed? It touches on an unspoken assumption. The lefties might all have the same beliefs and might all say the same things and might all be wearing the same pussy hats and might all be carrying the same printed signs, but *they are all unique individuals* who happened to come upon these exact same points/etc because **they're just that smart.** The NPC meme points out that, well, they're not getting all those ideas from their own galaxy sized brains. They're getting them from, well, indirectly from Soros mostly, but from alpha lefties who hand them out. The Rachel Maddows and the ShareBlues and the Media Matters of the world. And on some level... they know this. And it makes them feel really, REALLY uneasy. 3. Finally, you have the fact that the NPC meme is people mocking the left. *Mocking.* **The left.** The left, which is comprised of the best of humanity. The left, who are smarter than everyone else. The left, who have the most perfect golden morality and ethics and beliefs. ***How DARE you!?*** And yet... everyone is.So, a perfect storm - poking several deep seated insecurites the left has, all while laughing at those insecurities and their reaction to it all.

They will quintuple down in a way you haven't seen. They will foam at the mouth for Trump's impeachment, make everything look like a Kavanaugh hearing, aggressively promote racialism and sexism, have full-throated support of socialism, and look like some sort of Star Trek Terran (Social Justice) Empire where you are promoted by assassinating your superior with sexual assault the blowback causes Trump to get re-elected in 2020, and before 2022, the leftists drive a truck bomb into a federal building, kill less than 500 people, and every left-wing MSM site (and several senators) will agree that it was a regrettable necessity to end American fascism, and the true victims of the attack were the victims of the Trump The blowback from that will be so angry that the normies actually get really mad and start hurting people. Then and only then will the remaining Democratic establishment disown the leftists, and the Dems will have to completely reform into something new. The moral panic of social justice will end before 2022, but not without more than a few dead bodies if the Dems have a marginal win. I think at this point a blue or red wave would actually be better in both cases because a blue wave would put the establishment back in charge, and a red wave would make the democratic establishment re-consider their approach early.Social Justice can not survive long term because it is an ideology that is to tribalistic to maintain its coalition of racial and sexual identitarians. Their means to power are built entirely off of [emotional abuse]( They burn more people than they can take in, and the whole thing will come crashing down.*The problem* is not whether or not Social Justice ideology will die, it's how many people they take with them.The end result of ""Social Justice"" and in general is that someone will eventually come up with a new of how Marxism can be applied in the future.

But at least 40% of the reason he's in office is the emotions of his bad example. Better one, Why do people shoot people who break into their homes? 90% of people breaking into your house just want your TV. This is not a problem that requires lethal force. So why do home invaders get shot? Because the guy holding the gun is scared of the potential fact that the home invader *doesn't* just want his TV. Even though that's most likely *just* not the case. So yeah, it's great that Destiny can just fling statistics. Even better that he has that kind of brain that can actually recall statistics. I don't think hes ever been caught being wrong about a statistic. But he's arguing from very much the wrong place. (I think even he knows this because in all his arguments he seems to try and lead his opponents to admitting they believe feelings matter.)And I think you kind of *have* to admit feelings matter in order to be a liberal. Especially if you want to argue that things like racism and sexism are bad. Because if feelings don't matter then ""Know your place silly woman and/or nigger"" become viable arguments.",1
"Call white person ""white person"" in a derogatory way? That's cool.Call hispanic person ""white person"" in a derogatory way? Whoa, that's white people are being used a placeholder for an insult.

Of all the prejudiced assumptions our society has against men this is the most insidious.

"**Here's a trailer / store review (or personal impression, if you will):** The first contact with your game is through its title and short and they already tell me this is a politically charged game, and that the game takes a clear side in the culture war. At this point, I heavily suspect it will be heavy handed and preachy. My suspicions are reinforced after I start watching the video, as it contains too many ""buzzwords"" which makes it seem like it's a game aimed at die hard anti-SJWs only, and makes it feel too forced. Should be more subtle with these things. The action and the written explanation on the store is not good enough to convey what the gameplay is about to most people. You should show and explain better the game mechanics. If people are confused about your game from the get go, they wont even bother downloading a demo, much less buying it to try and refund if they dislike. The FAQ has a better but most users will not go out of their way and delve into the forum to try and figure out a game whose first impression was ""being weird"", or ""confusing gameplay"".I obviously didnt play the game, but the feeling I get from the material presented is that the SJW theme is just a skin that could be ripped off from the game and it wouldnt change the experience one bit, or even make it better from not feeling so forced or preachy. It feels like an after thought since it doesnt seem like its integrated to the gameplay aspect of the game. You could turn this into an office battle royale themed around office rage and work and it would be all the same, or possibly work better.I don't mean to sound harsh or anything, these are just my personal, unfiltered thoughts from my first contact with the store. In this context, my personal reaction would be to click ""not interested"" and ignore it. Your game is competing for attention with not only thousands of others, but also with the backlog of each steam gamer. Your first battle is to grab the interest of the public to keep looking at your video or reading your Your second one is to aptly convey what your game is all about, how it plays and instill a desire on the user to go out of their way and buy it in a short video and / or As it is, the store lacks hooks and incentives for that. i wish you good luck.",1

Again, I question how much design and development this job Tanji:** Emi Tanji has, according to LinkedIn, been a Senior Graphic Designer for Wizards of the Coast since 2007, and an Art Director for WotC since February of 2018.So there you have it. Most of the women that were said to have ""worked on the game during the development of its most recent edition"" seem to have been involved with the artwork (which, to be fair, is a perennial hot-button issue for regressives) or were involved with licensing and brand management. At least one (Trish Yochum) doesn't appear to have been involved during the development period at all, unless she was an outside contract. (I don't have my 5E books with me to check.) Either way, aside from issues of the art, this really seems to be stretching the definition of ""involved.""So slightly more honest than normal for typical games journalism, I suppose.",1

"Prosecutors have decided not to charge Long Beach Councilwoman Jeannine Pearce with domestic violence or driving under the influence in connection with a June clash with her former chief of staff.But a district attorney’s memo detailing the decision also raises questions about the Long Beach Police Department’s response to the June 3 incident involving the councilwoman and Devin Cotter.In its initial statement, the Police Department said it received a call for assistance from the California Highway Patrol about a possible drunk driving incident on the shoulder of the 710 Freeway in Long Beach at 2:40 a.m.The city’s officers smelled alcohol on Pearce, who admitted to drinking that night, according to the district attorney’s memo. A field sobriety test conducted about 4 a.m. showed she was mildly impaired.But the memo said a test of the councilwoman’s blood-alcohol level was not conducted until 4:20 a.m., nearly two hours after the CHP called. At that point, the test showed Pearce had a blood-alcohol level of 0.06%, under the legal limit of 0.08%, the memo said.The testing device used on Pearce was unreliable, the prosecutor’s memo said. A department toxicologist had recommended it not be used a month before the incident. Additional tests were not performed, according to the district attorney’s memo.A police spokesman said in a statement that officers initially investigated whether domestic violence had occurred when they arrived, interviewing Cotter and Pearce before realizing that the councilwoman had been drinking. At that point, the officers called for a colleague who is a certified drug recognition expert to investigate, Sgt. Brad Johnson said in the statement.He said the testing device had been “tagged to be replaced but was not removed from its storage cabinet. The officer who retrieved the device did not realize ... and unfortunately used it during the DUI at the scene saw Cotter with swelling, redness and a cut to his head and cuts to his hand, according to the district attorney’s memo. Pearce at one point had shoved Cotter, causing him to fall to the ground, the memo ultimately decided that Pearce, who was elected to the City Council in 2016, could argue she was defending herself when she shoved Cotter.In an email to The Times, Pearce said Cotter had thrown her “keys, iPad, and many other things” off to the side of the road during the argument on the freeway shoulder. Asked about the delay in time between the arrival of responding officers and the administering of a sobriety test, Pearce said she was questioned about the confrontation with Cotter for “some time” while the investigators were “waiting on someone that was bringing the who could not be reached for comment, served as campaign manager for Mayor Robert Garcia when he was elected in 2014 and later served as a legislative deputy to him until July 2016, according to Cotter’s LinkedIn page. He then left to work as Pearce’s chief of staff until February 2017. Pearce and Cotter had “dated before, during and after” the June 3 incident, according to the district attorney’s memo.The two had been driving back from a concert, where both had been drinking, when the altercation occurred, according to the memo. An argument ensued, and Pearce struck Cotter on the arm because he was “causing the car to dangerously swerve” on the freeway, the memo said.Both gave “multiple inconsistent statements and thus both have proved to be inaccurate reporters of fact,” Deputy Dist. Atty. Janis Johnson wrote in the memo. But evidence supported the councilwoman’s final version of the events over Cotter’s, Johnson the evidence was a text message Pearce sent to her new chief of staff asking for help and a video the councilwoman took that showed Cotter yelling a threat to release disparaging information about her to “the press, her husband and her employer if she did not meet certain demands while holding her car keys,” Johnson wrote.Long Beach police previously said officers did not find “sufficient cause” to arrest either Pearce or Cotter at the scene. Pearce was driven home by a friend, according to police, and Cotter was taken home by the responding tried to confront Pearce again hours later outside her home, the councilwoman said. He was arrested on suspicion of public intoxication a short time later, according to police.In a statement released earlier this year, Pearce said she had been the victim of domestic violence in the months before the incident and that police were investigating, though she did not accuse anyone by name.“Since late last year I have experienced escalating threats, harassment and stalking,” she wrote.Pearce said those incidents remain under investigation by Long Beach police, and she declined to elaborate Thursday. She also expressed frustration that she had been cast as the aggressor in the incident.“I find it frustrating that as the one that called [police], that was trapped, and was faced with fear that I was listed as the only suspect in the matter. This is one example of the challenges for women (and even men) in speaking up about psychological abuse,” Pearce wrote in the email. “The burden of proof is not a bruise on the outside, ones easily seen.”Pearce has said she was not “pulled over” June 3, but had requested a police presence at the scene. Earlier this year, CHP’s Southern Division Chief Chris O’Quinn told The Times that his officers came upon Pearce and Cotter because they were involved in a “heated argument” on the side of the freeway.Long Beach officers have closed their investigation into the June 3 incident, according to a statement released Wednesday. The district attorney’s Public Integrity Division is still conducting a separate investigation into “alleged inappropriate activity and conflicts of interest” in connection with the incident. A spokesman for the district attorney’s office declined to elaborate.",1

"In her defense, there was no reason for her to be slammed to the ground face-first. Just like there would be no reason to slam a dude face-first into the ground in the same [Here]( is a video from a different perspective showing the head-first body slam. Warning- there's a LOT of whining. I recommend going to 0:30 to see the slam. Yeah, she had hit the cop and obstructing him. So yeah, she should be arrested. No pass on obstructing and resisting just because you've got a vagina and you managed to not be overweight. Yeah, she was making it hard to put the cuffs on. But cops should be trained to determine how much force it will take to get an objective and to then not exceed that. Just because you've got the strength to slam a person's head to the sidewalk does not mean that it is the right thing to deploy when there's not any real danger in the situation (unless she starts clawing at the face). This could happen to your grandpa after he had four too many beers and wouldn't leave at closing time. It's not about gender or It is about having law enforcement that isn't trying to escalate just so they get a chance to relive their high school football or wrestling glory. I've had to fight my (more drunken than I, but not by a lot) brother on a sidewalk in Amsterdam once (note- New Years in Amsterdam is a lot of fun and I highly recommend against it). There are plenty of safe ways to put a person on the ground that don't involve risking damaging their football works by the principle that when you hit an opposing player so hard that he doesn't want to be hit again, he doesn't play as well for a while. We do not need to use this mentality in our policing. We can use it in the courts. But not on the streets. It DOES take more skill on the part of the cops to subdue someone without hurting them. Similarly, it takes more skill to body-slam someone than to just shoot then in the chest 9 times. We don't tolerate cops shooting people who are not an immediate threat. We require them to use something that admittedly exposes them to more risk and requires more skill on their part. Why should other extreme escalations of force (without regard for the subject's safety) be okay? This could be your grandpa.",1

"There are a few things people criticize Star Citizen for, and some of them are completely it a 'scam' seems pretty since the dev team is constantly expanding and improving the product. Clearly money isn't being socked away in someone's offshore bank it has taken too long has more merit. But after the unexpectedly wildly successful kickstarter, the project manager asked the backers if they should similarly wildly expand the scope of the project... and most were in favor of it. So all that money went into a much bigger game than was originally their methods of raising funds have also been criticized. And for me, this is the seediest part of the game. Offering a land claim token which will eventually allow them to choose land in the universe to gain legal (though imperfect) NPC protection for is silly. On the other hand, the process has been very open and clear to all from the start, so anyone who does contribute funds should know what they are (and aren't) getting.I paid for a game package because I liked what I was seeing, and I'm still pretty happy with it. Even in its current state it's got some things going for it that are better than other space sims on the market. But in the end, the proof will be in the product itself.

What is vulnerable about a group that was able to pass a motion to halt any and all criticism of said child-raping gangster and his barbaric ideology for violent conquest? What's vulnerable about a group that can travel anywhere in the west they want without being vetted, go on welfare, and if anyone says anything that isn't liberal bubbly gushes of sunshine and love about it, they get publicly branded a nazi biggot racist fascist islamophobe homophobe transphobe uneducated redneck piece of shit?Right.

"without forcing women to major in STEM you will gonna never get early communism, we had quotas in factories for women, after about 5-8 years it was clear to everyone that the women cannot work as much and as hard as men, an the ""factory 5 year plan"" was in danger...Then they created something called ""TESA"", meaning ""non-working workers"". These ""workers"" were in offices, and usually were part of the ""management"", but in reality it was a shitty bureaucratic system that slowed down the factory...So they employed women in TESA positions, as most factory floor positions were men, in order to ""equalize"" the genders.The results was this: everyone wanted the nice non-working positions, therefore no one wanted the shitty labor intensive workplaces. The factories got so bogged down by the lack of workforce that they started to pay (even in communism... imagine that) far better the manual labors than the university degree TESA workers.Years later, a 8 class low skill manual laborer (male) could afford a car (total decadent luxury) and yearly seaside holidays (another decadent luxury) while a high skilled university degree TESA worker (usually a woman) could barely afford to live....And the irony was that when the system collapsed, the working men, that got the best wages and best stuff (free holidays, free free food) were the ones to revolt and topple the system... not the shitty intellectuals from TESA that were too scared to do shit.So... even if you mandate it, you still gonna get shit back.

Nothing she says can be trusted. > Don't get me wrong, there is a bit of likeness to the Irish resistance to the Elves, but its not quite an allegory, but you can certainly see some elements.

In the books Elves are far, far from the innocent victims, they are quite the cunts and Geralt is aware of that. Not that humans are in the right, its just that both sides are really ugly in a special way, but I think that is too much for the writing team to handle let alone the intended agreed. In the past writers used to include hardcore, deeply felt political messages intwined in a story that not only left you wondering who was right, it left you legitimately wondering the author’s motivations. Today SJWs like their political messages as clear as a North Korean painting of the dear leader. Polish writing/art especially is smart, and doesn’t hold your hand.

The timelines don’t make sense, big plot points change, suspect description changes, or the suspect has definitive proof of the lie.I’ve commented on a case of mine before where when I talked to the suspect he showed me texts from the night in question from the “victim” saying no one could find out about them hooking up or her boyfriend would hear.Well the boyfriend heard and when I showed her the texts (from her to “suspect”) she just apologized and got up to leave the room (like that was going to be the end of it). Taking her to jail was very satisfying. Cops still should have due diligence to investigate all claims like they are true.

Demanding an apology for allowing someone to speak while you support segregated housing is fucking insane.

That's because he realizes raising his son takes time and effort, as well as money.

"In regards to games When Dragon Age 2 came out I was pumped. I looked at the BioWare devs acting like fucking clowns and brushed it off. (Although, ""When you press a button, something something awesome has to happen. Button. Awesome. Connect."" is permanently burned into the part of my brain that responds to cringe.) Still pumped. Then I played it. I remember the exact moment I raised an eyebrow. It was in Kirkwalls lowdown at night, and I'd just dispatched a group of enemies. Then another one appeared out of nowhere. Then I turned the corner and the exact same thing happened. These combat encounters littered the game. And it's not the good kind of combat encounter that's fun. It's the bad kind that's only there to make it difficult to walk from point A to point B and pad out the length of the game. And speaking of padding out the length, there were so many fucking reused levels. It's really not funny. Like, no other game I can think of has such poor variety in levels. But fuck it, I'll enjoy the story....Oh wait, **there isn't one.**And I don't mean ""The story is bad."" I mean it doesn't fucking exist. It's just a series of disjointed events that somehow explode into a war and also that trinket you found in the deep roads was super important. Aren't you glad we told you nothing about it? But... Well the original dragon age had a kind of disjointed story too, I suppose. I guess I'll enjoy the characters. Let's see... You don't get points for keeping combining the best parts of Awakening. Because we've already played awakening. Fenris is... No. Isabella is... I gave her to the Arishok on every playthrough because if she's gonna cause a bunch of Chad's to invade a city because someone stole their nerd book she really is too dumb to gave meaning to the phrase ""Burn it before it lays eggs."" In my mind. So no, Dragon Age 2 was BioWares worst showing to date in my mind. So I decided to check the the reviews were glowing. All of them.And I sat and thought about this for a while, how can something that came from a formula they'd knocked out of the park on the first try, then fucked it up so hard, be so well liked?Then I saw all the ads running on the pages for the reviews.

"If this person found D&D so off-putting because of how the races separated themselves from each other, then it doesn't make sense for him to also be a huge fan of Tolkien's work. The different races in Tolkien's world barely tolerate each other, only cooperating when their literal existence is at stake. Elves live in their forests and shun travelers, and eventually altogether leave the world en masse because they find Middle Earth unbearable. Dwarves hole up in their mountains and lock the doors, eventually dying when something more powerful than them shows up to take their stuff. Men are either self-assured that they have no need of the other races, or are too busy trying to make a living to worry about other races. Orcs, trolls, goblins, and the like exist to fulfill their own primal needs of hunger, conquest, and bloodshed; for them, the good races exist only to be slaughtered, enslaved, and eaten.And the Hobbits want nothing to do with any of them.Most D&D settings are going to naturally be more homogenous than Tolkien's Middle Earth. I don't think that's a good or a bad thing, just that it is.

A glitch in an algorithm meant to delete hate speech may delete stuff that isn't hate speech, but it won't edit comments in any case. Edit stuff is a completely different action. Even if it was an automatic process to replace swear words with it seems very unlikely that a glitch like this would occur. replacing the whole comment with stars? yeah, that's what I'd call a glitch. Completely rewording the comment tho? Either this is fake or something sinister is going on, glitch or not.",1

"So, ever the contrarian, I actually think the study is pretty good. I have plenty of things I disagree with, but it's clearly written with pretty honest analysis. I did manage to find a false positive listed as a Russian troll, but to be fair the guy was buying retweets and later deleted his channel and renamed his twitter, so it would have been easy to drop that account through the cracks.The biggest thing that I want to draw attention to is that the researcher has repeatedly expressed that anyone focusing on ""muh Russian Trolls"" is completely missing the point of the study, which details how the bots are a tiny fraction of a fraction, and that most of them have since been purged by twitter.In reference to he says ""This one gets it right."" an excerpt from that article:>None of that is to say this was Bay's intention. The 38 page research paper explains his methodology in-depth and with great clarity. He draws conclusions based on the dataset he has acquired and even states that it has ""limitations"" and the study is of a nature"". In his conclusion, he remarks that the assertions made within his paper must be considered only within the ""limited scope of the data set"".>He knows that makes for a less exciting worked as a journalist for many years, I know how the game works,"" he explains.>Bay is ""moderately disappointed in some of the major media brands"" that ran articles without taking the time to get a little deeper. He understands that some of his findings were buried because they produce a less enticing lede than ""Russian Troll Army invading the Star Wars just not what his research suspected Russian trolls are so few that it is basically the normal amount of Russian trolls you would expect to be present in a high-profile online debate.""And now for some tweets:>I don't come to that conclusion at all.**Some journalists have wrongly extracted that from the paper**. The paper just shows that there is deliberate happening, i.e. people are inserting partisan politics into Star Wars discussions now for different reasons. true. But having worked as a journalist for many years myself, I know the game. ""Russian trolls invade Star Wars galaxy"" is much more fun than ""Angry alt-righters use Star Wars fan discussion to vent political viewpoints"". Or ""On social meda, people are political"" 😀 That's the real question, isn't it? And **if everyone could stop focusing on the tiny detail about Russian trolls in the paper**, they would find at least a partial answer in it: People fanning the flames for political reasons, even in SW discourse. all due respect to the journalist, the study actually says the opposite. There's only a small number of bots**, but an interesting number of trolls, and a lot of people with a political agenda. Also, I graduated, thanks 😁. has nothing to with it. Russian trolls are everywhere, they insert themselves in discussions all over the Internet and have done so for years. Star Wars fandom is just another venue. The paper is on deliberate of fandom in general, not just Russian efforts. the paper. That's not what it says. **Suspected Russian trolls are a tiny group within a larger one**. The Russian troll activities target anything where disruption can be made. But it's just a small part of the findings. this guy is low-key roasting journos and randos that didn't read the paper and are only interested in getting that juicy ""RUSSIA!!1!!"" clickbait, which, ironically is another component of how insanely political literally everything on twitter is these days (i.e. the thing he was ACTUALLY studying)As a final note, he's also perfectly willing to talk to people who have criticisms of the work, even tiny YouTube Channels:",1

"People whine this sub doesnt support liberals or hates them. This isn't true. Here's the thing. And reminder, jokes require truth as an element to be funny.The left can't meme. Why would shitty memes get up voted in general? They don't. They left can't meme. One in five hundred sure. So left wing memes don't go anywhere because they suck.The left can't argue anything past surface level bs. Many of them have the depth of a puddle, mentally, and can argue one position. The one you read everywhere. The one jerked off in every leftist subreddit. It's never taken beyond that. Ever. It's just jerked off. People whine fox news is bias. Fox news started as a Christian network to combat leftist perceived slant, so, suggesting they are bias when they literally started to combat liberal news is beyond retarded. It's tiring listening to leftist media whine about trump all day and not report actual news while saying they are neutral and its frustrating talking to people who can't see the difference. It's boring talking to people that do the same. You don't learn anything you just keeping staring at the same wall, never walking through any doors. Talking to a leftist is watching paint dry. a cheer leading slogan. Their views fit into the character limit of a twitter comment. What they promote and what they do are 100% the opposite. The left act like women. It's tough being around a guy who acts like a woman. It's tough talking to loony leftist women.Its not that the left isn't tolerated here, it's that they are often horrible stereotypes with nothing interesting to say that offers critical thought, funny thought, etc. Nothing that's worth up voting, nothing that orzbluefog thinks is amazing. A leftist laying out a step by step plan of how anything they offer actually works, that would be a good thing to add. Yet, nothing. Go look at a libertarian party and you'll see a real breakdown of how something needs to be done. Look at leftist, it's just ""get government to do it"" or ""raise taxes, create a tax.""So firstly why did you read this (I'm killing time in a hotel) and secondly I want to hear a leftist actually lay out a plan and be the first leftist to actually do fuck all anything worth reading.",1

"tl;dr is last paragraph.It looks like you're going to work on the ""east side"" which is the area. If it's a tech job, understand now that tech workplaces are pretty bad in most places when it comes to the social justice set.I lived in Seattle and outlying areas for a really longtime. The city has drastically changed for the worse. It's not yet San Francisco bad, but they're trying. city government is more corporate oriented, so you'll still see pro-business Republicans in municipal government. They tow the party line on most social issues but it isn't a of that said, Western Washington is a really diverse place. Want to live in the woods with rednecks? You can do that. Want to live in a trendy condo? No problem. Want a suburb? Plenty to choose from, and it's all commutable to the east side. For the most part, you can live in the sort of place that suits you and the amenities in the urban core are superb. State government isn't great but not nearly as bad as things you need to know about:1.) The rain is oversold but there is a marine layer over Western Washington for about 7 to 8 months out of the year. It's really, really grey.2.) The cost of living is terrible, Traffic is a nightmare along the I-5 and the I-405. Seattle is willfully shrinking traffic capacity and the east side simply can't build enough. Topography aggravates this. Avoid bridges.4.) Politics have radicalized over the past 20 years as Californians and people from the East Coast have flooded into the city for tech jobs.5.) Yet large corporations like Boeing, Starbucks, Microsoft, and especially Amazon dominate the political and economic landscape. It's really the worst of both worlds.Good things:1.) The economy is great.2.) World class food, festivals, beer.3.) Water, mountains, forests, all within an hour drive. It's an outdoors man's paradise.4.) Once you get away from Seattle most people are really chill. Sometimes too chill. 5.) Sea-Tac is a real international airport.6.) Great sports is an 8 on the California scale. The east side is a 5. Most of the rest of Western Washington is a 3 or 4. If you can afford the cost of living and are capable of biting your tongue now and then, I'd say don't hesitate to give it a go if you have a real opportunity up there.",1

What a lot of them don't realize is that they can dismantle the things that they see themselves as fighting against without hurting those who they believe benefit from them. Dave Chappelle put it best. South Africa and the dismantling of apartheid should have been a blood bath but Mandela and his recognized that those who benefited from the system were also victims of it and doing away with the system demands between people, not destruction.",1

"Her own facebook post, ran through google translate and might need some more adjustment - but anyone reading this should compare it to the actual movie above. Its WITH HATE CRIME MOTIVE On January 11, 2018, I was on my way home from work at 5.30pm. I was in a hurry to get the son from school closing at 18pm. I'm in a hurry, the train is coming soon. walk through the barriers. A white middle-aged man in front of me, turns around and stops me in the middle of the barriers and says to me ""go on your own card."" I stand between the barriers, they hit me hard in my back. He blocks my way. I ""But I have a card"", and is about to show him, but there is no time to do it.In the next moment, I feel how he grabs me with both arms, squeezes me hard into a corner at the latches, pushes his knee to my body, preventing me from touching and holding me with both arms. I get scared! I push him away with all my power. He gets pissed off and says ""damn dirty N-word hora"" while pushing me so hard that I trip through the barriers. A black man runs forward and tells the white man to stop ""Beat a Woman"".I'm both afraid, angry, offended, shocked, sad and desperate. The man continues to call me N word hora. I defend myself, strikes back! I refuse to be violated, afraid and depressed. Everything is recorded on video.The man reports me for abuse and I am making a counter notification of abuse of hatred motives. A week ago, I received a letter home that my application was canceled but the husband's application to me is not I'm suspected of abuse. My report is closed because, according to the police, ""it lacks objective evidence of support"". The male's application is not laid down !!The police's racism has already determined that he (white man about 185 cm) is the victim, and I (black woman about 163 cm) is above, despite defending myself in distresses and the man started the attack on me from nowhere!It's me who has back injuries, was hospitalized because of shock, got sick, got colleagues who follow me to the track because I'm afraid to meet the man.It's me who was attacked by unknown white man in the subway, and subjected to an afrophobic hate crime. The police never investigated my notification as a hate crime and they never registered the hate crime scene before my notification was Sweden, about 25% of all racist hatred is avrophobic. The most common hate crime against black people is a violent crime of unknown white man. I am one of those victims who carry on the damage of racism, afrophobia and hate crime that the police are kidding in.I am tired of the racism of the police, everyday racism, hatred and threats against black / brown people. I'm tired of 34 years in Sweden, to constantly bear the blame and become a victim of society's structural racism that permeates all authorities. I am sad that we who are exposed to racism never get settled. But the game must go on !!! SHARE GET! """,1

There is no studio out there, at least that I can think of, that is actually innovating in terms of the technology and mechanical design that the games are built from. Modern game development studios make great products, but that means teams are replaceable top to bottom. You need to prove to people you are irreplaceable by being too good to be let go, or you need to start your own studio so you can dodge this issue who was recently fired from ArenaNet after a dispute with fans over dialogue boiled over into a harassment campaign that successfully pressured the company into cutting her loose, knows all too well that game companies are unlikely to stand behind their employees under even the slightest strain.No company wants someone who has a history of being an unruly cunt, especially to its customer-base.

One might rationalize this as Western journos not serving Japan-only news, but this hasn't stopped stories of similar scope before, like Japanese game announcements from Tokyo Game Show that may not necessarily get a Western release. Plus, this story very much has a relevant Western element to it, not only in that it will impact all future efforts to release Japanese games to the West, but also in that Sony's new censorious policy is being dictated by back further, there also appears to be little coverage of the latest Senran Kagura game being delayed and censored due to the policy, the first sign of the new danger.

"I'll copy/paste my [comment]( that guy's annoying. From what I've seen, the article on it was accurate. In fact, I read more or less most of the report myself. Now, what's discussed in this video is this article: I've previously ignored (because I've read the source). At the time the story came out, they put out 4-5 articles (I don't get it either, so don't ask me), and this article has had all of... 371 comments. The article I've read, however, has - up to now - 14,101 comments: it's accurate. As for what the person in video objects to, it's these parts of the article:> Page 14 of the document acknowledges that a few Silicon Valley tech giants now “control the majority of our but that these platforms – including Google – must now break their initial promise to users of free speech and content this:> Google, argues the briefing, must move towards the European tradition and create “well-ordered spaces for safety and civility” rather than “unmediated marketplaces of I'd first contact the person that wrote it. But, that's just me. Since the same person wrote several other articles as well. In the other article - the one which I read - it notes it accurately:> The briefing argues that Google, Facebook, YouTube and Twitter are caught between two incompatible positions, the “unmediated marketplace of ideas” vs. “well-ordered spaces for safety and civility.”> The first approach is described as a product of the “American tradition” which “prioritizes free speech for democracy, not civility.” The second is described as a product of the “European tradition,” which “favors dignity over liberty and civility over freedom.” The briefing claims that all tech platforms are now moving toward the European x is the case,"" obviously isn't the same as ""argues x should happen.""And:> The briefing associates Google’s new role as the guarantor of “civility” with the categories of “editor” and only line I'm not sure would be this:> For example, the briefing argues that tech companies will have to censor their platforms if they want to “expand globally.”It does mention it once or twice, but I'm not sure I'd say ""argues."" For example:> “US-based IT monopolies are already tempted to compromise themselves in order to gain entrance to these vast and fast growing markets. The dictatorial leaders in these countries may be only too happy to collaborate with them since they want to improve their methods of control over their own populations and expand their power and influence in the United States and the rest of the thing he objects to is ""Google admits."" I can see how it might be misleading, however I'd say it depends on whether or not the ""Insights Lab"" is from outside Google, which as another user notes it doesn't seem to be the case. If it is, then yeah, it's misleading. If not - and it might not be, because as the other user says there's the link that goes back to Google, and they do say it's ""internal research,"" then it's not necessarily misleading. Here's what Breitbart said on it in a recent article:> Perhaps they buy Google’s explanation that the presentation was just “research” and doesn’t reflect “official Google positions” — a confusing explanation, as the research is about official Google positions. Is Google disagreeing with its own researchers’ assessment of where the company is headed?I'd have still suggested contacting the author of the article first, but eh.Also this:",1

">A Warr Acres woman is accused of taking more than $450,000 from a man with Alzheimer's disease when she was supposed to be taking care of him.>Going back as far as 2011So she has been doing this for 7 years.>After gaining power of attorney over him, police say Smith-Frawner began by deeding his Warr Acres home over to herself via quitclaim deed for just $1.What the to court documents, she added herself to his bank account and, in 2015, started making withdrawals and writing herself checks. These include a $77,229.28 cashier's check ""used to pay off a BancFirst loan in the name of Cindy Smith in 2015."" Another was a withdrawal posted to the victim's account in October 2017 in the amount of $29,371.86. That was a payment ""made to Honda Financial to pay off a 2016 Honda Accord that was registered to Cindy Smith."">The documents allege that in August of 2017, a $10,000 cashier's check from the victim's account went to Emerald Springs Spas ""for a down payment on a hot tub"" that was set up at residence. The total price of the hot tub and accessories was $14,489.10. Smith-Frawner also took out a loan for the remaining balance from the Oklahoma Educator's Credit Union, then a month later, $4,682.39 was taken out of the victim's account to pay off a loan at the Oklahoma Educator's Credit Union.>Then, in October 2017, $295,000 was transferred from the victim's bank account to her personal account, one the victim did not have access say the total equaled over $450,000. They note that that number does not include other suspicious transactions, the value of the house she allegedly did not pay for and a Chevy Avalanche that belonged to the is accused of taking most of the Navy veteran's life savings, and leaving him a little more than $40,000.>We did, however, speak to her attorney, Billy Bock, who insists the man cared for Smith-Frawner like a daughter, and knew about the was done under his wishes,"" Bock said. ""I understand he doesn't remember that now and it's sad. I wish he did.>My client did not knowingly deceive or defraud or take money away from [him] in any way other than what his wishes are,"" Bock said.This lawyer sounds scummy at penalties could include 37 years in prison and $85,000 in fines.This is all. This is bs. She will not get the max. My guess is she will get less than 10 years. So steal $600,000+ and only have to pay back $85,000.I am guessing the house was worth more than $100,000 dollars.So the $450,000 + other transactions not included in the $450,000 + $100,000+ house = say the total equaled over $450,000.

"This could be a little incoherent because I don't sleep much these daysI say that gatekeeping is good and proper. People build a little community the way they like it, and would prefer to keep it that way. It makes sense and is natural. Why would they want someone(s), who were not involved in the building, to come along and take advantage of what was created and then change how it is to suit the newcomer's taste? Which is essentially what's happened with any nerd fandom you were made fun of for in high school but now everyone wears the t-shirt because it's en vogueTo use your example of ""doesn't want smelly girls in their boys-only pillow fort"", how many of you, when you were kids, were forced to include someone you don't really like/know into your game, and they go about changing it or members of the group do so the newcomer I remember we were basically doing DnD LARPing when we were 10 or so and a kid the principal forced us to let him play with us didn't really get it. But he did watch the Kevin Sorbo Hercules show so he just wanted to be Hercules and beat shit up. Or a girl who turns your super hero fights into playing houseBut the more important question, I think, is how hard it is to get past the gatekeeper. In my experience, it's usually really easy to disarm people by asking genuine questions to show interest, and people generally like to feel like their opinions or knowledge are worth sharing. If you ask enough questions, and play some games to put the answers to those questions into play, suddenly you are a genuine member of the fandom, or you lose interest and leave, instead of being someone screaming at the gates to be let in come hell or high water, BAMNThat being said, gatekeepers should remain at the gates, and not wander around trying to test everyone. Speak only when spoken to about the topic and all that. And there are always more zealous you'll always find someone who has absurdly high standards before accepting you as a true member of the fandom. The important thing is that not everyone is like that. It's always annoying how quick people are to deny having traits attributed to a large group of people, yet are just as quick to assume everyone part of a group of people are all the same. I am sick unto death of all these ""x fandom is the most toxic fanbase ever"" type the more people that get added to a group, the more things get watered down. I don't know if it always has to be that way, but as far as I've it always has been so far. There is definitely a difference between hardcore gamers, casual gamers and people who fuck around on their phones. And if you like your gacha games, or your easy modes, or if wanting to gouge your eyes out is a normal part of a game's then that's fine. You do you. You don't HAVE to be a part of every cool thing that comes along, every trend and fad. Gaming is founded on git gud, same as sports, and I don't hear people wailing about needing to lower the skill level in sports. If you can't git gud in gaming, then become a spectatorSo keep gatekeeping so your preferred thing stays spicy, before it gets watered down to tasteless paste",1

"Hey, what happened to equality? I thought all of us were for it.So if a chick kicks a guy, it's equal to a random dude kicking kicking him and if he is justified in beating his ass up, he is ""equally"" justified in beating her ass up.Besides, she started the fight, he ended it. And don't start telling ""she was doing it for fun."" What do you think would have happened if the guy did that? The chick could have him kicked out of the bus and have him branded a offender and ruined his life faster than you can say 'Feminism isn't about a cunt doesn't magically make you a fragile hits you? Knock her the fuck out. if no one wants beatings, better keep your hands and legs to yourself.To the guy in the video: if you're reading this, you did good.

"This seems to a bit of an idiotic topic but there is some merit it in perhaps... though I have seen anime that does the opposite. I'm not talking about like pointless abuse. Honestly in a lot of anime, they abuse the concept of smacking a guy around because he is a dense fucker and can't knock before entering a annoys me a bit too but it isn't a monolith. Take Maken-Ki ecchi as fuck anime. That happens to the main dude, he literally forgets because he rooms with a few chicks. Now it's possible to forget, but in a small defense of them. If you forget 24/7 that's being fucking Secondly this guy does peep on chicks sometimes, so it's hard for him to claim innocence because sometimes he really *isn't* innocent.As much as I found inuyasha to be garbage for this, and other reasons, it made a lot more sense in Ranma 1/2. Ranma *went out of his way* to poke at his, somewhat Sure people should get over their but when someone has about not being feminine enough maybe when you have to live with them you shouldn't tell them like 8 times a day they suck at being a chick. Ranma was a dick to both Akane and other people at least half the time.Now, on the flip side you have recent shows like konosuba and Aho Girl.Kazuma right out states he's having none of this bullshit. he will also smack a bitch if he thinks she's being an idiot, not that ti works with darkness cause she's a kinky masochist and gets turned on by that, even when he acts disgusted at her behavior in public and means it. He will routinely tell aqua she is useless and a bitch in public- because she is.In Aho girl main dude is possibly a bit of a dick but he has lived around the main sex obsessed bitch for his entire life, her precocious ass would routinely do things to him in their childhood that he didn't want to do that might well border on sexual assault, he was too physically weak to stop her. This lead him into gaining more strength, probably mostly just happened because puberty. He now due to her current actions and past actions *knocks the fuck* out of this chick, who is in fact so fucking stupid she routinely gets zeros on all of her tests **all of them**. His aggressive, pretty much assault and battery, treatment of this chick scares everyone around him especially the other chicks, but he just has no more patience for this chick who is selfish, stupid as and a **MEGA THOT** obsessed with his dick.So both extremes exist and largely played for comedy. The chicks doing it to dudes is more common but let's see western media even as a joke try to do some of the dudes not putting up with chicks bullshit. It wouldn't fly- Japan doesn't seem to give a fuck maybe because they don't seem to be as psychotic over there and realize that shit ain't real.",1
