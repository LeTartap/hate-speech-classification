Are you sure you’re not lashing out at me because you fell for it and now feel stupid and it needs to be someone else’s fault than yours?This was a prank video that’s been posted before and the vast majority of this sub completely **gobbled it up as fact without it.** If you can’t see the wider danger of that then I don’t know what to tell ya.",0

[Just shy of 2% of researchers admit to intentionally fabricating data and over a third admitted to other questionable practices in published As the authors of the linked study admit, ""Considering that these surveys ask sensitive questions and have other limitations, it appears likely that this is a conservative estimate of the true prevalence of scientific misconduct.""",0

"I thought it was decent when it came out, but Waid is overrated. A big tell in a flawed story is if your introduce a key conflict--it may not be the main conflict, it may only be the second or third if it's a key conflict to the story, and it's resolved by some lazy deus ex machina (in this instance, dei ex machina embodied in Shazam), that resolves a critical story is flawed. One of the big conceits of the book was that there was this prophecy about the bat and the eagle in conflict. through three issues it was implied it was Bats v Supes, then SHAZAM PLOT TWIST, it's Bats v Wonder Woman, and in issue four they're duking it out and SHAZAM! instead of resolving the intractable conflict between side A and side B...humans decide to nuke super humans (thus ending the conflict between Bats and WW...which was a freaking prophecy and treated as critical to the story up to that point) and Supes and a brainwashed Shazam have to stop the bomb (and half fail in doing so). Ok. You ended the Bats v WW conflict with a distraction. It's a freaking Elseworlds story. You are given the license to have Let key characters die. Let one side win. Have cajones. Re. Solve. The. Con. Flict. Waid is tame. His personal antics have more drama and consequences than his fiction. Dude could never create anything new, write some science fiction novel, build a universe. He's a fanboy that was competent in managing the month to month tension of comic book writing, but good at nothing else. Neil Gaiman could invent and write outside of comics. Joe Hill. Even Kevin Smith, who started in film then went to comics in back. That's impressive. But these fanboy writers are just dull hacks (Waid, Busiek). I don't need grim and gritty or anti-grim and gritty or any theme or motif, just invention and creativity. I never, ever understood why those fanboy writers were put on a pedestal in the mid to late 90s. Tame writers. They're the same quality as Roy Thomas, with the exception that Roy a) actually created new borderline A lister characters (Vision) and quality B listers (Black Knight) (Waid and Busiek have done neither), B) Thomas was responsible for much of the Marvel Universe webbing, creating connections across character families that created the networked feel of the Marvel U in the 70s (see what he did with Asgard and the Eternals and ingenious for comic writing) and carried in the 80s (that even Lee and Kirby (the creators) failed to do), and C) isn't worshipped as a god like Waid and Busiek are. I'm listening to Scriver's broadcast yesterday on Waid and DinC, and yikes....I'm torn between wanting these stories about Waid to be true and not be true, because if they are true, man, what a despicable human being (him and Dan Slott) and if not true, then that type of trolling accusations just degrade society further (in our anonymous oriented culture, I don't know what to believe is true when people speak roughly anonymously about me a skeptic).",0

Looking at Call of Duty and how your character dies more often than surviving I can argue against that.Or Bioshock Infinite where Levine tries to go all cryptic with the ending I knew how it was going to end with the protagonist dying.Or Last of Us where Joel damns humanity to selfishly save Ellie only for her to lose what little idealism she had in the sequel.Or Dead Space Awakening where the franchise not only dies but humanity utterly fails to stop the the tranny cunt wants is something where the actions of the protagonist dont matter. Stalingrad vs Grave of the Firelies is a good comparison of how the the tone of death reflects on the endong. In Grave of The Fireflies. The brother and sister dies but kobe lives on as they realize in spite of it all their deaths are not in vain and the city will find hope again. In Stalingrad 1993 movie.

">The premises in the presentation are that censorship by the platform owner is acceptable provided the rules and effects are clear, is politically neutral, and focused on tone, Some moderation exists on every virtual platform that I'm aware of. The point that Insights is making is that you have to identify what your moderation is going to be and effectively communicate it without taking a political bias as a platform. That's entirely reasonable. >They see the platform owners as ""hospitality organizers"". That's just a quote giving context to their primary point, which is: ""People are asking how to behave on your platform, rather than solely how not to"". This means that they are saying that users want to understand what is *supposed* to be their standard of conduct, rather than just what *isn't* their standard of conduct.>For one, I don't see any more a ""hospitality organizer"" than I see my email provider: they provide a service by which I may communicate with others. The standards I use to communicate with friends are vastly different than those I use for business contacts, and I neither expect nor desire those standards to be enforced by the email provider.These are wildly different things in both a digital and legal sense. Your emails are *private* You literally have (under American law) an expectation of privacy which *even the police* are not allowed to violate without proper judicial and legal grounds. Public comments on a public platform to engage in a public conversation are going to be totally different and have completely different moderation. I'm not even convinced it would be *legal* for Goggle to moderate your these providers already see themselves as politically neutral and focused on tone, so following those guidelines just gives us more of the same. And of course tone itself isn't politically neutral: see the censoring of the legal term ""illegal aliens"" (though to their credit they appear to have backed off on that decision).The report specifically tells them to be politically neutral as part of being more consistent with their rules because tech companies *haven't been*. Google's failure to learn isn't a problem with the being transparent about why you'e censoring someone doesn't really help the person being censored that much. We know exactly why The Daily Stormer was deplatformed: the GoDaddy CEO woke up one day and said ""I hate these guys and want them off my site"". Transparency helps when the rules are consistent. That's the point. You have to do both, that's why both are recommended. What happened with GoDaddy is an inconsistency of the application of rules, not a lack of transparency. If GoDaddy were to be consistent and transparent, they should have a rule that states: ""GoDaddy reserves the right to remove your domain, without notice, at any time, because the CEO doesn't like what if I don't want these platforms to ""police tone""? Tone policing exists in a social context, whether you like it or not. It's why you can't just run up to someone and start screaming ""FAGGOT!!!!"" in their face, and why American law would probably allow them to hit you to get away from them. *Some* boundary exists for tone. The point that Insights is making is that you should be policing tone *and not content*. SCOTUS does the same thing with the first amendment. It's why the government is not allowed to engage in ""viewpoint but is allowed to arrest you for disorderly conduct if you won't stop if there is a problem with ""tone"", why enforce a top-down, one size fits all approach to it?They actually say that users will have shifting desires and demands, and a one-size-all approach doesn't fit.Is fifthly a word?...>When Germany censors things it's to ""make online spaces safer"", but when ""dictatorial leaders"" want to do so it's to ""improve their methods of control"". One is the justification of the German government (which you see everywhere in lots of governments), and the other is just a quote from Soros.>And on the page where they discuss flagging porn (which has regulations around providing access to children) and malware (which has quantifiable harmful effects) they provide a case study of The Daily Stormer (who was engaged in legal if unpopular speech) being taken off the internet, thereby trying to create a (strained) association between the three.The page is about ""active curation"".

"Lack of confidence. ""What am I talking about, you ask? Uptalk. That ever-growing tendency to end statements with upward inflections to make them sound like questions. Like you're not quite sure what you're saying is true. Or clear. Or will be acceptable to your audience. To suggest that you're willing to back down, or restate your point, or change your viewpoint altogether if your listeners don't nod their approval.It's a nasty habit. It is the very opposite of confidence or assertiveness. It's gotten all out of control. These days even statements about which there should be no question or doubt are presented in this tentative, timid and deferential manner. Here's an example. I teach a 4th year university course in which part of the requirement is a seminar presentation. Students used to stand up and share the results of their research in a way that conveyed their confidence and knowledge. They no longer do. Even if they do feel confident, their culture now mandates that they dial it back and sound like this:My name is Jennifer? My seminar today is on bystander apathy? There is quite a bit of research on this",0

"Among the stupid shit Verhoeven added, changed, or left out to make it look bad.1. Conscription is banned in the Terran Federation, ( I'm pretty sure it applies to the movie but it is never explicitly stated or stressed ), not only that, but you can quit anytime you want, even right before a combat drop (Though you won't get your citizenship). Heinlein was very critical the American Military's use of conscription and devotes several paragraphs to deconstructing it and even name drops the then contemporary Korean war as an example. All the more ironic when you consider Verhoeven's own misgivings about the american military.2. In the book, the mobile infantry is an elite army utilizing orbital drop-pods, and power armor with enough fire-power to level city blocks, ( A formation with soldiers a kilometer apart is considered and dangerous risk for friendly fire, and at one point Rico uses mini nukes ) Essentially being WH40K Space Marines in all but name ( Minus genetic modification). That Is why they fight without tanks or artillery, which are explicitly stated to be obsolete compared to an M.I. soldier. The movie instead makes the M.I. look like the WH40k Imperial guard if it was led by Zapp Brannigan, rushing masses of ill equipped soldiers like a moron.3. You don't need to be a citizen to have children. The only rights a citizen has over a civilian is the right to vote or run for office in the Terran Federation.4. There are other forms of service apart from the military one can sign up for that will grant citizenship, though they are similarly dangerous, dirty, and grueling.5. The Bugs are a technologically advanced race with an interstellar empire, not just some wildlife on an isolated planet. The attack on Sao Paulo is most definitely *NOT* a false flag, as the movie implies.6. No attention is given in the movie to the near non-existance of racism, racial strife or sexism between humans in the Terran Federation. Units are mixed with people from all ethnicities and cultures. The Main character Juan Rico is in fact Filipino, though even book readers might miss this, as it is only inferred through two random lines where he mentions [Ramon and that he speaks tagalog. Obviously Verhoeven couldn't let people think that anything other than globohomo peace and tolerance hippie ideals will lead to a internally peaceful society. 7. For the M.I. recruiting office, they hire only the most crippled and mangled veterans they can find. The one Juan Rico meets is missing half his face and 3 limbs. His job to scare away anyone who isn't really dedicated and to make it very, very clear what dangerous dirty and grueling life you will have in the M.I. which itself is *extremely* selective, only %9 of Rico's starting group is able to pass and complete training. There is no propaganda machine brainwashing people, and there are no illusions given that service will be anything but dangerous, dirty and grueling. ( this is somewhat related to points 1 and 2 )",0

(33:21)** If the Prophet didn't shake hands with women, it makes sense for Muslims (who are told that he is a good example to follow) to do the same and refrain from shaking hands with people of the opposite gender.And if that seems extreme, consider this next verse: **""It may be that you dislike a thing which is good for you and that you like a thing which is bad for you. Allâh knows but you do not know."" a Muslim believes in Allah, they also believe that His knowledge and wisdom are infinite.

"This is just your regular reminder that pornographic loli images are in fact illegal in the USA due to the PROTECT Act of 2003.

[See of the PROTECT Act of 2003 were ruled unconstitutional so loli pronography is ok! The law was upheld to be valid as long as the work is deemed [obscene per the miller test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miller_test) in both the [Whorley](http://www.ca4.uscourts.gov/Opinions/Published/064288.P.pdf) and cases. The Handley case did cite that the sections that don't also require the work to be deemed obscene were too overbroad but they also cited that, ""This conclusion has minimal impact on this case given the almost complete redundancy of the conduct criminalized by subsections 1466A(a)(1) and (b)(1) (SIC: The sections requiring obscenity) with that of subsections 1466A(a)(2) and (b)(2) (SIC: The sections not requiring obscenity)."" Other sections have also already [survived a supreme court challenge](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/07pdf/06-694.pdf).>All the convictions also involve actual child pornography so it doesn't count. [No they aren't all like You can find some searching the [court archives of them It's important to keep in mind that DA's typically like to charge you with anything they can think of and see what sticks. Being convicted of this law along with other violations doesn't negate the fact that loli pornography, which is going to be deemed obscene, is still illegal all on it's own. Also it's important to realize that prosecutions for this are really rare. It's typically used as a way to add time to a sentence or as a way to get you for something if their original accusations fail in a similar fashion to how Al Capone was convicted of tax evasion.>If prosecutions are so rare than it doesn't matter. It's true the prosecutions are rare, as LewdGamer's essay clearly outlined. It's as likely for a private citizen nobody to get caught solely for this as they are of being caught downloading movies off a bit torrent. However keep in mind that is only going to apply ""nobodies"". Public corporations and public figures are under greater scrutiny. Just because you likely won't get caught doesn't mean a publicly traded company can publicly allow it. It's very similar to how you will not see public companies endorsing piracy.",0

This has nothing to do with SJWs.The most common archive thrown around to prove that ""KiA was always about SJWs"" is [this taken four days after the sub's creation. ""We were talking about SJWs to boycott, we were talking about SJW influence, how is that not proof that KiA was always about SJWs?"" Because you're talking about corrupt journalists to boycott, and essentially [reposting shit that was already on at the time.

Ideologies? Yeah, that's what I was talking about when I said ""SJW stuff being pushed by outlets like Kotaku and Polygon,"" those were the main targets at the time, the places that everyone shat on.I know it kind of looks like me hand-waving away a bunch of relevant shit (trust me, I've heard that one before), but my main point is this: The cornerstone of KiA, and the reason why it exists, is because of the exposure of gaming journalism's rotten core. That's what drove boycotts, that's what drove the emails to advertisers, that's what led to digs and finds, and what kept KiA active. The community was already mostly anti-SJW, due to overlap with TiA, but that doesn't necessarily make anti-SJWism part of the bedrock of the sub any more than pointing out retards on Twitter.Somewhat ironically, while finding my old links for this, I ran across [this Seems like KiA was debating on whether it should be about opposing SJWs when it was still a couple of weeks old.",0

"Oh, no, I'm aware of that. I'm very well aware that reporting on news and events was never unbiased, not just in BBC, pretty much everywhere. I was born and grew up in a former Soviet satellite state in Eastern Europe which was ruled by a genuine hardcore communist party for half a century (not the Antifa larping fragile mangina cucks you see on the streets today). We essentially had one and only one news source distributed by the Party and all other alternative sources were completely subservient to the Party anyway. Anyone who even tried to think differently was sent on a one way trip to a camp... 'scuse me - ""labor"" camp. And this was going on until 1989. Trust me when I tell you - I am painfully aware and ""trained"" to spot bias, it's pretty much a second nature.I guess my point is that I'm not that much disappointed by the BBC bias, that's a given. But by the thing they are reporting on. Even in the ""good old"" communist propaganda days journalists were busy reporting on real issues, actual events, actual politics. Something that affects everyone, that everyone knows, everyone understands and cares about, something that is affecting your life, something that has a meaning. An election, politicians meeting, an armed conflict, economics, crime etc. Despite the obvious bias, news were actually meaningful and valuable news, not diluted garbage that makes no sense.Do you think that even half of the population now knows what ""misogynoir"" means when they hear or read this drivel on the news? Or what ""gamer girl"" is? Or ""preferred gender pronoun"" is? This is what I'm upset about. Not the bias, the fact that these ""giants"" of journalism are wasting tax payers money and time to report on completely useless garbage, the fact that some moron with a gender studies degree gets paid from our own pockets to present something so retarded as ""some chick got called a bitch while playing a video game"" as actual news.

The war on drugs is still locking up PoC at far higher rates then whites even though drug use is equal among the races.

You understand what I'm saying? We knew we couldn't make it illegal to be either against the war or black, but by getting the public to associate the hippies with marijuana and blacks with heroin, and then both heavily, we could disrupt those communities.

I can understand people with no principles being confused by this, so I will explain:The principle being, tech and media companies should not be playing gatekeepers of morality, thought police as it were. The precedent being that not even the government is supposed to do this.Just because it is currently legal(generally speaking) to do so does not mean that it is ethical, as in not oppressive, to do so. Everything is legal until it isn't. Slavery used to be legal, for example.If Jones wins, it would be a legal precedent that can potentially protect everyone, *including you.*See also: Businesses that are big enough or virtual monopolies of quasi-necessary nature can have a bit more obligation than your average Ma&Pa brick and mortar store. This is where other anti-discrimination laws above and beyond the basic constitutional amendments have come into play as arguments were made and justified to protect the life and liberty of people who were being oppressed. As in non-governmental employers or housing being liable for discrimination.See: not even necessarily legal. Businesses that have a close relation to government can sometimes be liable for 1A breaches under ""state action"" or ""state actor"" connections. also always civil law, where people can sue for damages.TL;DR It's the principle of the thing, not necessarily loyalty to Jones. Also, there are myriad ways this could potentially be argued to be illegal(that is why courts exist, to make these determinations). Legality is not limited to only the First Amendment.",0

">""Patriarchy"", in feminist lingo, largely seems to mean ""society that is run by men and is structured so as to benefit men at the expense of women"". The basic definition. I wouldn’t say it’s made to benefit men *at the expense of women* though. I would say it’s a society where being a man and masculine is the default, anything else is extra, less than, not as good, etc. >You attempt to redefine it as ""the things in our society that hurt men"" is as pathetic as your attempt to pretend that anyone who dismisses male rape victims is an anti-feminist.I was giving examples of how a patriarchal society can harm men. I thought that was obvious. And yes, the men who are congratulating children who get raped are not feminists and embrace toxic masculinity that says males must enjoy sexual attention no matter what and if you don’t want to have sex you have the strength to fight off an attacker. No feminist would congratulate a rape victim. And most of those men also add in little quips making fun of feminism or “sjws” and women do this too, I’ve seen plenty of comments saying “Oh come on, a boy having sex with his hot teacher is not the same as a little girl being raped by her teacher! Feminism has gone too far lol”> Feminists are incapable of admitting that they have privileges in our society, What the fuck is the original post doing 😭😂>which is why they always phrase it as ""the patriarchy backfiring"" rather than say the words ""female privilege"". It’s not a privilege to be coddled. I’ve seen feminists use the term “female privilege” plenty of times. You can search the term in any social media (if you can sift through all the antifeminist comments and posts bashing all of feminism because women have these few “benefits” from patriarchy) >Feminists also very often cling to these benefits like a drowning woman to a spar of rock, and will defend them viciously. c.f. the National Organization of Women fighting against a presumption of joint custody (because men don't really want their children and just want a way to hurt women), “Presumption of joint custody OR sole custody” isn’t that what men want? >the founder and CEO of the Feminist Majority Foundation dismissing the existence of male DV Pointing out the fact that women are more likely to be victims is not denying that men *can* be victims. God forbid *this* organization focus on the majority of people who need help. >decrying the notion of legal parental surrender as ""men who just want to have sex without facing the consequences""Abortion is not the same as having a child and then deciding you don’t want anything to do with it with no repercussions. A fetus is not the same as a child. Autonomy is not the same as avoiding a bill for 18 years. >or the Women's March inviting Donna Hylton (convicted of torturing a man to death) And feminists reaction to it: Rasmeah Odeh (convicted of a terrorist bombing in a cafe that killed two people) as featured egalitarians believe that in our modern society, men and women have unfair advantages and disadvantages in different areas. Equality will be brought about by erasing both, since the advantage of one is a disadvantage of the other. So how do you “erase” an advantage without taking something away from a group? Wouldn’t you *have* to raise the lower group up in order to level things out?

"I didn't read the article since OP is a man and therefore an inconsiderate cunt, as proved by him not linking the article. This might be relevant: I've read a big thread on a body building website about personality changes with T. It was really sad. The guys were all saying it was fine, they either didn't notice much or felt they could handle it OK. And a long procession of women were saying how their loving partner or brother tended to become a selfish, arrogant, insensitive, uncaring asshole while on T. They would refuse to believe their partner's distress was worth stopping the T for. So long as they didn't hit her they could not see the problem. T and empathy don't seem to correlate within a group but they strongly correlate in an individual. It is common for men to become more empathetic as they age, I guess because of falling T. It also is commonly noted in fathers, our T drops during pregnancy and stays down a while after birth. There is a huge excess of women in the caring professions in all countries - nursing, primary and secondary teaching, childcare, aged care, GPs and therapists, social workers. [Edit:]",0

She rotates between reasonable, smug, outraged, and distraught rapidly sometimes through hysterical tears to laughter within a matter of seconds. She's seeing which strategy will play best with the situation at hand but you can tell doesn't feel any of them besides smug very deeply if at all. Of course it would be criminal of me to not mention her attempt at accusing the officer of not caring about rape victims. She attempts to publicly shame him to either get her way or punish him for not giving in to her illegal and demands. It's the modern left in a nutshell. EDIT:Ten seconds from emotional breakdown to smiling at her 2: No one will actually see this edit but I wish I had written more about the ""you would ignore it if I was raped"" (summary not a quote) bit. What it really was I think was an attempt to incite a witch hunt targeting the officer. Imagine if that crowd had started screaming that, he might have gone ahead and removed Crowder to save his own hide. The mob doesn't care if the allegations are true, it's just blood in the water. It's become true for them once it's in their mind. SJW thinking is mob mentality writ large. I've been thinking a lot about this clip and how this interaction troubles me so deeply.

Actually that's a common one across many Disney classic cartoons, if the ""Princess"" has a father, they pretty much always disobey them even if they're shown to mean well, in order to make the plot happen. Just the ones off the top of my head: Mulan, Jasmine, Ariel, Briar Rose, hell even older cartoons like Thief and the Cobbler Yum Yum fools her drowsy dope of a father into not executing Tack by breaking her own shoe.Now, the exceptions are those that don't have fathers, like Snow White or Cinderella or Belle (I believe, but then again I've never watched Beauty and the Beast), but then those were pretty much the same cases in their Grimm's Fairy Tale versions, they are unique situations where the woman doesn't have a father figure like the others and the themes and messages being told are different. Even in Snow White, where in the original story version she is the daughter of a King, the King plays literally no role in the plot other than to make Snow White a princess by her birth.

"That was decided in 1973, with language that had no definition as to what an obscenity actually is, how one actually determines what is an obscenity, and what any of the terms involved are.You might as well argue that the Supreme Court upheld slavery at one point, which it did, so why argue against slavery?As I said, the Supreme Court has attempted to punt at every opportunity on deciding the actual use of Miller or exact definition of obscenity. In the age of porn on demand, and expanding protections for non-political free speech in America, one good criminal prosecution that doesn't end in a plea deal could see an appeal go to the SC.And morals are not the basis of the Constitution. That's a conservative fantasy. Rights are not based on morals. They're granted by the virtue of existing. Free speech doesn't exist because your sky wizard commands it. It's a right derived from the need of the individual, and it doesn't require the agreement of the state or of others. The Constitution guarantees individual rights, not group rights, because those rights exist naturally for the individual. Obscenity is the very definition of a group punishment upon the individual, the offense of others as a reason to inflict tyranny on the conservatives make me sick sometimes. The willingness of such types to lock someone up for making drawings or writing novels, to deprive them of liberty because their sky god's jimmies are rustled, as interpreted by priests and their captive that would lock up another human being for scribbles on paper should never speak of standing for anything resembling human dignity.

Sure that would seem self evident without any further information.

The crazy thing is not what Adolf wants, but the way he starts out to get it. I know he’s a clown, but by God, I like the boy![...]The Semitic mind, like the Celtic and Teutonic, seems to possess marked mystical inclinations; and the wealth of underground horror-lore surviving in ghettoes and synagogues must be much more considerable than is generally imagined. … Jewish Folklore has preserved much of the terror and mystery of the past, and when more thoroughly studied is likely to exert considerable influence on weird fiction.As you can see, the factor wasn't skin colour, it was other-ness, the state of being other, which was the result of his pathological xenophobia. And yes that manifested as believing that blacks, being the most different from Anglo Saxon whites, where in fact inferior, but as any one who has studied the man & his works can see that was the result of his pathological xenophobia. and it's a good thing he was, if he wasn't we wouldn't have got any of his stand out work, since his work, which is predicated on the fear of the other, simply would not exist without it. People who just declare that Lovecraft was racist & leave it at that miss the point. His hatred wasn't about skin colour, it was about other-ness, which he described as being inhuman & that's how he describes anyone that wasn't a white anglo saxon of british stock.At least in theory, since he then went on toe marry a Jewish woman.

">Not an argument. Here is a link about the topic- it's Wikipedia but it isn't my job to educate you. You can find primary sources there if you want. The article reflects what I learned from African students and immigrants I've listened to. This is not even considering BLM, which is explicitly pan-African Marxism. That's amazing. You do know that Africa is a continent, not a country, and that the cultures vary a huge amount between it's coasts? Egypt is not South Africa is not Zimbabwe is not Chad is not Cote d'Ivoire is not South Africa is not Mozambique. To paint all of these things with a brush that says ""socialism"" without addressing how specific countries address it is completely insufficient to form judgement. To make this make sense to a self-important North American: culture is different in Texas than it is in Seattle. Lousiana is not the same place as North Dakota. America is unique in that a huge landmass is considered unified, but the states are unique. Africa is about 30,000,000 square kilometers in size. Europe, which we consider diverse as Spain is not the same as England, Germany, Ukraine or Russia, is is my issue with your statement about ""African Socialism"". It's in that there's no unified 'africa' for it to represent.>If immigration were handled responsibly, this would not be an issue. This is the entire point of people who want to see immigration reigned in. We know that people vote in their own interests. Their interests are going to be ""give me as much stuff as possible "". That is how resources in Africa are shared traditionally, which you will learn if you put any work into learning about it. ""give me everything"" is pretty shortsighted and not true of all voters and voting blocks. Again, I'm glad to see that you view Africa, the 30 million square kilometer landmass as a single, unified country, as though it were, say, France, or Belgium. It's also a nice deflect of the problems of two-party systems, which necessarily lead to problems like this one - you get a forced ultimatum based on a single aspect of policy. >It's not long at all.

When you say ""our"" population, which do you mean? Does this same view apply to people from France, England, Belgium, Sweden, Latvia, or Russia? Do citizens, born and raised in Canada to parents from other countries, not count a citizens even though they have the same birthright claim to ""our"" population as anyone else born on Canadian why does the Liberal party have to be out of power at any cost? They're problematic, absolutely, but you can pressure the party through public opinion rather than demonize and put another government in power.

What's more insane is thinking 1) more than 50 people in canada will reach that amount and 2) that people coming anywhere close to that don't have accounts to work around it.The larger problem is that that tax money is actually useful.

This is like someone from Nunavut and someone from Mexico showing up in France and the French person says they have the same ""traditional North American values"".>and it is reflected in the infrastructure of Canada vs that in any African country. They believe in pooled resources and equal outcomes. This flies in the face of the reasoning that predicates why the West doesn't look like Fucking Somalia. So do we. Do you think healthcare and public education aren't a result of pooled income for equal outcomes? If we didn't give a shit about equal outcomes, we wouldn't have public schools. Furthermore, how do you think fucking roads would be built without pooled income? And yet, even with these pooled resources for equal outcomes, we still don't look like Somalia. Maybe, just maybe, there's more to this.>That means nothing about his cultural values. He was chosen as his current role because he's SomaliCitation please. The man's been elected to public office twice and was selected for cabinet this time. Even if he was selected because of his background, how does that in any way invalidate his qualifications for the role?>ergo his identity must affect his decisions. He was raised in a Somali household. If he didn't want to change Canada he wouldn't be advocating for it. To be fair, a lot of the resistance to your views on immigration comes from a hardline ""no immigration at any cost"" stance that seems to be popular these days. It's also pretty rich to complain about Canada being changed and not mentioning shit like gerrymandering or issues with real estate being used as a bank for foreign billionaires. It's also ignorant of demographics changing due to industry meddling, like the Irving family in the Maritimes or the loss of manufacturing jobs around the country due to trade deals. Whether you like it or not, time moves on and demographics will change anyways.>It's a toothless fucking money sink that has done almost nothing of consequence to stop genocide and human rights violations in its most egregiously oppressive countries.

A leader would be able to read the room, adjust accordingly and handle the situation in a way which seems the best possible way. Did he get up too quickly? Absolutely.

"> just post it up without thinking and it doesn't matter if it all gets proven to be bullshitThat's modern digital media in general, topped up by the ""Women are wonderful"" effect. It's all about getting clicks and generating ad revenue through click-bait and absurd stories designed to get readers to look at whatever the link takes them to. So story titles that don't tell you anything and require you to look at the article, even if it's the complete opposite of what the title suggests or flat out false, see [Betteridge's law of for such an example.Then there are the stories claiming ""firsts"" because of particular sex/genders/races etc when there are numerous examples of the case throughout history, especially in modern media shows.For recent examples see how the media fell over themselves about how Star Trek: Discovery had the first black or first female captain, ignoring Sisko from DS9 and Janeway from Voyager. The story changed various times because people kept pointing out how such claims were wrong. Firstly Michael wasn't the captain, nor was she the first black protagonist, nor female protagonist. Goal posts kept being moved whenever it was shown how wrong the stories were.Ironically such claims erase the previous actions of the characters/actors that came before them, but then again instant gratification is a fairly common thing these days where it's all about *now* and the past isn't really worth bothering about, unless someone finds something about it wrong by modern standards and therefore needs to erase it, because erasing history has always been a good idea.

In addition, Wakanda doesn't need to be warlike because they have the cloaking technology to hide, so their weapons tech isn't as advanced as some of their other types of tech.I imagine if this story had taken place in a country in Europe that isolated themselves pre-Eastern contact we'd see a lot of crazy sword and shield technology instead. Come to think if it, doesn't Cap carry a shield? Isn't Thor a melee weapon user? And aren't those weapons also vastly superior to modern weaponry like Maria Hill's?",0

"There's outrage from people who know the characters. That's something that people seem to not factor in. Not everyone knows about Heimdall, I sure didn't before the Thor movies. Only knew Domino from the Deadpool *game*. And other than some forgetful roles in some games like iirc Marvel Alliance, I never heard of Nick Fury either. And it was only after the fact that I replayed them that I really took note of the fact it was Nick Fury. ""Oh..."" Hard to be more memorable than Samuel L. Jackson. I was mad at Prince of Persia casting. Since I love those games, and know the character. Still haven't bothered to watch the movie. Also hated Fan4stic for racebending Johnny. That changed character dynamics of a brother and sister. It's just retarded. People defended with with Alba ""not being white"" except she's half white so it's not really that comparable. generally I'm against it even if I don't know the character, since there's almost always existing characters they could use instead. See Starfire in Titans, when they could've just used Bumblebee if they wanted to use a black woman to play an ORANGE alien [that they didn't paint orange]. And there's always the option to invent a new character. I believe the Asian police officer in the new Spider-Man game was invented recently in the comics. But these people aren't creative. So they just swap races with existing characters. They could create the next Harley Quinn if they were talented, but they're devoid of talent. Which is why their great ideas are to just change an existing character's race.",0

"I play GTAO and recently just argued this with a friend. If you have a desire to just buy shark cards, then you don't actually have a desire to play the game. Over the past few months, simply logging into the game has netted me millions of GTA bucks. They have double cash promos all the time and they have giveaways all the time that simply hand you money.Now, if you wanted to invest time into the game and actually play it then you should have enough money by the end of doing everything to buy almost everything in the game. All the DLC is end game content. It's like buying an expansion pack with virtual currency. And once you have the CEO expansion with a garage (probably $2mil you can do car heists to make money. This alone makes buying shark cards for someone who doesn't have time anymore super easy. In 15 min, you can quickly make and more if you collect a set of cars.Shark cards are for two people: people who want to play that don't have time but want a fancy car to run with their friends OR people who think because a new car is out, they must buy it like some autistic gamer.All the things you buy in the game for the necessity to have fun are cheap. If you need the fancy stuff, play the game as intended or spend you money.Back in subject though: Cheating should never get you any time in jail.

"> It’s not a privilege to be coddled. I’ve seen feminists use the term “female privilege” plenty of times. You can search the term in any social media (if you can sift through all the antifeminist comments and posts bashing all of feminism because women have these few “benefits” from patriarchy)It's comical that you pretend like feminism has no problem acknowledging female privilege, even as you refuse to use the term yourself and feel the need to put even the word ""benefits"" in scare quotes. Hell, go on a half dozen feminist communities and start a conversation about ""female privilege"". Let me know how positive your reception is. Odds are you'll be derisively called an ""MRA"" and shown the door.> “Presumption of joint custody OR sole custody” isn’t that what men want?I haven't seen too many men arguing for a presumption of sole custody. Presumption of joint/equal custody, however, is something many father's rights groups do fight for, and the NOW fights *against* this, often with arguments about how joint custody is merely a tool that men use to abuse their former spouses.> Pointing out the fact that women are more likely to be victims is not denying that men can be victims.

"Clearly, you didn't read the articles I posted.I define SJW propaganda as ideologues who are terrible writers pushing their hard left politics into comics.You called me alt-right, because - in your warped reality - you pretend that I'm asking for a comic book industry that mirrors the Matrix in the Matrix Revolutions; Everyone is a Smith Clone (aka white, straight male). Ask yourself: **Who wants to see that?** For example, Vox Day is trying to capitalize on Comicsgate by creating more right-wing comics, or comics with right wing themes. Personally, I don't want to read his comics; **I don't want right wing comics. I don't want left wing comics.** I don't want to read comics where creators push their politics into it. All I want is what I grew up reading; apolitical, fun stories. By the way, when I say apolitical, I mean I don't want to read characters that are a mouth for political views and/or shilling. It's even worse when the writing is terrible. There are tons of female characters that I love in comics (i.e. Motoko Kusangi from Ghost in the Shell, Kitty Pryde and Rogue from the X-men, Lois Lane from Superman, Mikasa Ackermann from Attack on Titan, Huntress from Birds of Prey, Raven from Teen Titans). You know why I like these characters? Because they're awesome! The writers who write their stories do a good job, because they're good writers and are qualified. I can relate to some of them, and I enjoy watching them overcome their hardships. Now, as far as race goes, at no point did I say I wanted an all white cast of characters (or creators). Do you think I want Storm (from X-men) to be white? I would be pretty annoyed if they did something that stupid, since her African ancestry has been an important part to her character (If you've read Life Death for example). But here's the double standard; remember when Scarlett Johansson was cast as the Major for the live action Ghost in the Shell? Remember how angry people were, claiming that the Major is Japanese. They were talking about whitewashing! Now, if that's the case, then why does nobody complain when white characters are changed (i.e. Jimmy Olsen in the Supergirl TV series, Perry White in Man of Steel, Mercy Graves in Dawn of Justice, Johnny Storm in the Fantastic Four movie, etc) in the mainstream? Granted, these aren't the comics, but the principle is the same. I'll tell you why this is happening: *First of all, it's a blatant double standard.* Second, the people who do this claim that the race of the characters that they change is unimportant, and yet when the race of characters (who's race was unimportant in their own stories) are played by whites, they call it racist and yet, when ACTUAL fans point out the (because they **actually read/buy the comics**), they are painted as racists by the mainstream media, or as crybabies.So this tells me that the race swapping is a politically motivated move; they claim that ""people of color"" are This is all based on the politically motivated belief that white people are privileged, and that minorities are being ""forced out"". In other words, this boils down to the belief that ""whites are bad"", or that ""minorities are being And the annoying thing about it is that the creators of these comics/shows sometimes go out of their way to vilify anyone who points this out.This is why certain legacy characters at Marvel are being overshadowed by minority counterparts (Miles Morales, Riri Williams, the Asian Hulk guy, the female replacement of Thor and Wolverine, etc). If you actually read the articles I posted, you'd see why these characters were created in the first place. Part of it was to boost sales, but in the long run, these characters have no depth, because what's being sold to us are FEMALE and NON-WHITE characters, not HEROES. Who wants to read characters defined by gender and skin color? That's why the Alt-Right is annoying; nobody enjoys a character who's being sold for what they are. We like characters for WHO they are, not WHAT they are. And before you say I contradicted myself, remember that the race/gender swapping is a one way straight; the creators are doing this only change characters. And to make it worse, they openly insult this demographic for not liking the comics. What better way to sell comics than to insult a huge part of your reader base.Besides, why do you think many fans hate the new Star Wars films? They brought back the original characters, and then killed of Han Solo and Luke Skywalker. WHY? That's stupid!People who grew up with these comics are attached to the legacy characters (Steve Rogers, Tony Stark, Bruce Banner, Peter Parker, etc). They put these characters in the movies, but the idea of making movies based on comics is to sell the comics. So when you buy the comics after seeing the film, and then the characters you watched are overshadowed in the comics by their sjw counterparts, or completely replaced in the comics by them. That's what we call a This doesn't even make sense in an economic sense.I don't like Jessica Cruz because she's a coward who - in the beginning - was in a holding pattern of being an insecure coward, with little character development (until Dan Jurgens fixed that when he took over writing Green Lanterns; he actually created character development for the two stars, and made them enjoyable for once). It has nothing to do with her being female or Hispanic. What's happening in the modern comic industry is that characters aren't being treated as equals. They are instead being placed on a pedestal solely for their biological traits. In other words, giving characters special treatment and shoved into the foreground solely because of how they were ""born"". So, equality - if that was what was intended - isn't even being achieved in this form. The creators being hired to write characters that are the same race, gender, or sexuality as themselves in stupid. Just because you're gay, doesn't mean you can write good gay characters. In fact, it doesn't even mean that you're a good writer at all. Being a good writer should be the sole requirement for writing a character.I could go on forever, but here's my overall point: I don't want a comic book that look like Agent Smith's Matrix. I want good writing, good characters that are interesting to read, creators that are qualified as and characters are aren't a political for hard left creators. I just want apolitical (in other words, no propaganda) fun stories, like what I used to read when I was younger. I like super hero comics. I don't like SJWism. I don't like being preached at by hard left liberals (or alt-right people, for that matter).",0

"Not at all, actually. I literally mean that it's way easier and less time consuming to make a list of the positive things Trudeau has done for Canada. It's a little suspicious when someone comes to a subreddit like this and asks a very general, low effort question like that. This is a Canadian subreddit. If he was truly curious, just search or scroll for references to Trudeau. It's even more suspicious when he basically pisses himself in outrage over the fact that no one will jump through a hoop and basically write an essay for him. Because, yes, most of us here could go on for quite a while about disliking Trudeau personally, his policies, the direction he wants to take Canada etc. even though you're behaving like a child having a meltdown and making demands of people who owe you literally nothing, I'll answer your question. As a prime minister, I don't like him because of his policies. As a human, I do not like him in general.If you can ask a more specific question, you'll get more specific answers.",0

It emphasizes the point that these things are spreading to a degree where people who are engaged in a different part of a political discussion, will then move into a different area to keep pushing that agenda.”I don't want to be rude, considering he's reading this now. But this seems like such a blindingly obvious observation with such a wrong conclusion.Johnson said something inflammatory and accusatory about Gamergate. People who are interested in Gamergate saw this, particularly after the tweet was reported in the press and so attempted to engage Johnson about it. Is that 'pushing an agenda'?

That's why it doesn't make sense to say there aren't nonbinary people).You're right that society is totally geared to label people into M and F. But that's changing because people are are naturally biased to reduce any topic down to a binary. But as we know that doesn't reflect reality; it is simply a shortcoming of the way we process information (and normally it isn't a shortcoming and it helps us solve a lot of our problems).IMO 20 years ago a **huge** portion of society didn't *believe* in trans identities. They looked at a person and said: ""that's a dude in a dress"" or ""I bet that bulldyke is a (or whatever they said. I wasn't old enough to notice so I'll just be as offensive and basic as I can imagine lol). But now trans identities are commonly recognized and generally understood (especially since the time when GG started). I foresee that a similar level of understanding will organically (aka slowly) spread over the next 20 years about people who don't feel comfortable identifying as male or female.I might be completely off-base.

"Yep. Cannabis is the middle of nowhere (and even city) police departments’ bread and butter. Under current federal legislation it is permissible for departments to seize assets whenever they have “reasonable suspicion” that the suspect has been distributing “narcotics”. They DO NOT HAVE TO PROVE THIS IN COURT. THE SUSPECT CAN BE CLEARED OF ALL CHARGES AND THEY CAN KEEP THEIR SEIZED MONEY AND PROPERTY. Up to 90% of assets seized can be kept by the seizing local authorities, with the remainder being handed up the food chain to the feds. The reason given is that it strangles cartels by cutting off their resources. Can they explain seizing a couple’s home because their son was accused of selling small quantities of drugs? Pretty sure these otherwise unblemished citizens are not secretly El Chapo. SERIOUSLY GOOGLE IT. Here’s where marijuana comes in. Because of the PROVEN fact that marijuana does not have physically addictive properties, causes no craving or withdrawal beyond that which would be experienced by someone if you took their television away, it is a substance that you have a decent chance of finding at any given stop and search. Every kind of person in this country smokes weed. The CEOs, the preachers, the moms, the saints, the sinners. It has zero impact on a normal healthy person’s ability to function and live a normal, successful life. Its “addictive” properties are like those of sex or food, it’s only addictive to someone who has problems with emotions, self control, and/or discipline. Most humans can pick it up and put it down as they please, and those who can’t would have found something to have a problem with anyway. Leaving marijuana as a schedule 1 narcotic and continuing the charade of pretending to believe that it “kills kids” is what keeps local law enforcement in business in Bumblescum, NowhereState. Unlike the NYPD where they have plenty of tax dollars rolling in per capita and they just use marijuana statutes to intimidate and harass an poor and marginalized sector of the city, there is not enough actual crime to sustain their for keeping a force at all, let alone a force as large as they do have, and there is no money in taking down actual criminals (like rapists). So what is a corrupt department to do? You are a victim of the continuing playacting where law enforcement and other institutions pretend that they genuinely believe that marijuana is “a dangerous drug”. Everyone I have spoken to in healthcare understands that the health risks come from smoking via combustion methods and have the same risks as smoking cigarettes, except without a proven addictive substance involved that causes clinically documented physical craving and withdrawal. Additionally, the several contacts I have in law enforcement are extremely aware that marijuana is a relatively benign substance that is used as a tool against poor and dark people. Read the description of the first hearing to make marijuana illegal. They have a direct quote of an argument used to justify the legislation that I will paraphrase here: “.. you give a Mexican in the field a puff of a marijuana cigarette and he thinks he’s a bullfighter in Toledo”. More racism and classism. On the federal level, they claimed to have “isolated the active ingredient “ and injected it into dogs’ brains, a couple of which died. THC was not isolated and identified until WWII or possibly just after. This “study” was “performed” many years before this discovery. An educated population is the only cure, but I doubt it will happen in my lifetime.",0

"They’re not purely emotional. You can’t aggregate these things into empirical data, which I don’t ignore. There’s a bridge between that exists, even tho it isn’t qualitative to actual numbers. We have a president, who knows as much evidence as I know about the case, publicly decrying her. So it goes both ways in assuming she’s either 100% true or 100% lying. I’m striking the balance. Part of judging is weight the facts and testimony. I’m saying she was more believable based on comparing the two’s testimony. There’s so much evidence suppressed by the WH and they absolutely continue to handcuff the And based on SHEER character, BK was belligerent and very wayward. His deflection tactics were embossed by his disgust at being questioned. His inability to cop to things he shouldn’t be lying about (his drinking habits). The fact that even in his own calendar, he marked out a date that listed him hanging out with the very people Ford said we’re witnesses to what she have been put away for less evidence.And again, I think, even in conjecture alone, a testimony like what BK gave would never be believed if he were the one presiding and judging over. No lawyer would ever coach a witness like that. Let alone a judge who knows exactly what to look for. (Source: family of lawyers, many of whom lean right).And again, I think overall we live in a society of victim blaming for many things, not just rape. To designate it a culture is a step to far. But there’s a good enough segment of Americans who either say it wasn’t a big deal, say it wasn’t true (without even knowing) or if both are true, it’s something everyone has done.These all employ tactics to remove the blame from the accused, and to minimize the claims of the victim.Now tell me how any of this is emotionally based?",0

Westerns are a complex and problematic genre tied to a violent history that gave rise to the myth of the gun as an egalitarian tool (e.g., the oft-quoted “God made man, Sam Colt made them equal”) and rugged, self-reliant masculinity. As a result, interactions with *Red Dead Redemption 2*’s NPCs exist within that masculine framework. Arthur and the player’s actions are expressions of a mythic masculinity. We rescue women and lesser men—after all, better men would be able to fight off bandits and manage their horses— and compete against would-be gunslingers while using unique abilities like Dead-Eye to our advantage. We tip our hat like a proper gentleman, and we kill anyone we want. The game rewards those masculine impulses without fail.Jesus, this whole thing reads like a mediocre high school essay.",0

They took my ashes that were in a pill bottle (whole other story - aunt is a pillhead) because they thought it was coke?? Bone fragments visible in it and Then the 10month CPS case ensued. They took our oldest and placed him with my parents for 2 weeks until we tested clean. They tested our son twice for cannabis because he was breastfed, we didn't get his ashes back for about 2months after his death. They tried to put my husband and I in drug court. They denied us. Wanted us to go to a drug rehab center twice a week. Classes were separated by gender. This meant we would have had to go 4 times a week on top of my husband working full time, at the time. We're 30 minutes away from any towns. We demanded someone come to our house if they wanted us to do all that crap. So then we went through about 6 different counselors who came to our house every single week. He passed February 2015 and our case was not closed until December 2015. All because of cannabis. Such bullshit.",0

The proof was when it was found out that Serena is exempted to use certain drugs and supplements that other players aren't allowed to use. Under the guise of therapy. It's a loophole to cheat. WADA records were hacked to get this information. The UFC had similar exemptions to allow to testosterone therapy. You should see how a couple of those fighters looked. It's cheating. She plays tennis. It's all cardio. I find it impossible that she looks like a body builder. She really must spend all her time lifting like a power lifter and her spare time just eating. edit; much more detailed information on her career and all the PED incidents that she has been a part of. Very difficult to think she is a clean athlete. Serena then doubled down on her exemptions to claim that drug testing her is also racist.,0

"I, for one, will be forever suspicious of the so-called ""Age of Man"" when its proponents through the series form orders that are unabashedly built on greed, deceit, and murder, but I'll at least admit that the stories are purposefully made ambiguous as to let players come up with their own conclusions to what's going on and what factions, if any, are in the right.But that's not to say that I believe Dark Souls is hopeless. In fact, I'd say that there's something intrinsically hopeful about the series (and the titles) purely from the basic gameplay: players overcoming trials and hardships, vanquishing mighty foes encountered along the way. As for the story, I'd point to the End of Fire ending of DS3, which I'd call the best closure to the series as a whole, being built on the Fire Keeper's hope that mercy-killing the world altogether will eventually give birth to a wholly new one. It's just foolish to call Dark Souls hopeful by pointing to the Age of Dark, its nature being one of the series' most contentious story is a little more pessimistic in that none of the endings put a stop to the turmoil caused by warring Great Ones and their aspiring human servants, but at least the Yharnam Sunrise ending has you personally escaping from it.> So to sum it up. The guy wants more ""Real life stories about mundane boring people in a pessimistic tone.

Your initial assertion was that YOUR party was the party that freed the slaves. Then, you said Republicans magically became conservative. The implication, then, is that the Republican and Democratic parties of the 1860s bear NO resemblance to their namesakes today, and in fact have nearly opposite ideologies. So no, YOUR party did not free the slaves. A socially progressive party with the same name from 1860 that looks suspiciously like today's Democratic party did that. So when you said, ""And it were the mainstream democrats that tried to keep slavery, the woman vote down and were the racist ones. I know its hard to accept, but its democrats that always were the bullshit they are now"" you are really showing your idiocy, ignorance, or willing You yourself said that today's Republicans bear no resemblance to the Republicans of 1860, and the same is true of today's Democrats.

The way info gets presented in the other vids, it suggests YouTube is forcing the sponsorship on creators, and that just doesn't make sense to me. Regardless of how a sponsor comes into play, if all relevant info being told about the service is true and the option to not participate in the sponsor link is there, how are people being not sure if I missed something or am just blanking, but I'm fairly confused why people are attacking the quality of the service. The 2nd video seems to joke about how the woman isn't a doctor, but I don't recall any claims of every professional being a literal doctor. That video also ends with by saying this projects depression onto viewers, and I simply don't get that. If you're that susceptible to other's words, you'd either have to be an actual child or you really do need therapy. Without relying too much on speculation and by just looking at the info from the vids and my own experience, it seems that, at worst, BetterHelp and YouTube are partnered. YouTube identified relevant creators to be partnered with the service to advertise it. The information presented about the service and the service itself seem perfectly fine. I saw people having issues with being denied service and that they were suggested to see a physical therapist as opposed to online therapy. I get being upset at that, but how is that bad? Instead of not getting the help you need or giving bad help, they inform the person why the service wouldn't be beneficial to them. Like, I don't see what else could be done about that.",0

"Briar Beauty disobeys the fairies. She’s separated from her parents as a baby for her safety, doesn’t even know them.*Beauty and the Beast* is one that you absolutely need to see, the animated version is one of Disney’s greatest movies, if not the single best. It was the first animated film ever nominated for Best Picture at the Academy Awards, quite deservedly so (but it lost quite fairly to *The Silence of the Lambs* -- nothing had a chance with that kind of competition) and very noticeably contributed to the creation of the Best Animated Picture category. The recent live-action adaptation is watchable by the strength of its source material but it's very bloated, partially because of the completely unnecessary effort to establish Belle as having some kind of engineering skill (when she's already a standout by virtue of being an imaginative bookworm in a provincial village) and establish the villain's shitty little sidekick as gay (which was *horrendous*, he's like a walking minstrel show, and his switch to being a good guy in the middle of the third act is plainly forced and nonsensical to the point that the movie *even makes a joke about it*).Belle *definitely* has a father here, in fact his fuckup kicks off the plot — Belle goes out looking for her father after he foolishly takes a wrong turn on the road and wanders into the Beast’s castle, where he is taken prisoner by the Beast (her father’s horse returns without him and then takes Belle back). Belle, against her father’s wishes, offers to be the Beast’s prisoner in her father’s place, and her father returns to town raving about it all hoping to rally help to free her. Everyone assumes her father is crazy, so Belle and the Beast have time for most of the rest of the movie to is extremely and deliberately archetypal, it’s absolutely packed with stuff from Carl Jung.

"Ok, this can be a long one. People may think that i'm a hypocrite in saying that we should oppose feminism because they have a lot of sexist and misandrist feminists in their movement, while still I still support the MRM.First of all I don't hate feminists in the sense that I want them to be killed, hurt, raped, have their rights stripped from them or any such thing. I don't want any harm for them, or to have something bad happen to them as a form of I still hate feminists nonetheless. Why? Because I feel that every single one of them, even if they didn't do any sexist thing to men or said any misandrist thing to them. We are all humans, men and women alike, we both can be sexist and hateful, we both have sexist assholes who can infiltrate a a good movement and turn it into a hate one.The difference between feminism and the MRM is that feminism is more than 100 years old, it appeared in the the late 19th century, but we as movement we are still relatively new compared to them.Unlike us, they have a lot of power and influence. The most we can have is some mysogynistic assholes who spout some sexist nonsense in an Internet forum. They, in the other hand, can block laws, can pass laws, have feminist presidents in their side, have big feminists journalists, judges and professors. They can and already did a big damage to men.They did more than just say some sexist shit in the Internet, they actually stopped us many times when we wanted to have our rights or have equality for men under the law or socially. And despite that a lot of feminists labeled every single MRA as a mysogynist, and with us being a small movement without influence or power, we couldn't do shit.While every single feminists defended feminism by saying the famous phrase '' those are not real feminists, real feminism is about equality'' and enforced the notion that any single one who criticize feminism is a either a mysogynist male or a woman who suffer from internalized served as a shield for the feminist movement, which was a platform for misandrist and sexist cunts to hurt men and stop them from getting the equality that they wanted.The only thing that they did is just say that feminism is a movement for equality and that those are not real feminists. Instead of actually doing something, removing those feminists from the position of power that they have, and actually reversing the damage.But they only served as a shield, as a defense for the feminist movement, the platform that those misandrists used to fuck men up. Those misandrists who not only had a platform from where they can do the sexist shit that they wanted, they didn't had a real threat to them, since even the feminists who claim to be good didn't try to actively remove them and correct what they have done.Those good feminists defended feminism even if it made things worse for men, because they used it to get their rights,they used men as a stepping stone to have what they want. The ''good'' feminists had their rights, the bad feminists had the vengeance that they wanted from men. Those good feminists didn’t want to oppose those misandrists who had the power, because they wanted to preserve their movement so that they can have their rights even if it meant to have men as a stepping stone.So good feminists, bad feminists, both for men had a role in using feminism as hate movement to fuck men up. And that's why I hate. And I don't the MRM to become like feminism. I don't want us to fall in the same mistake.",0

"Okay I will bite.>for lying under oath would get punished the same as a typically very violent, and very physical act, First off what is being referenced here is not punishment for a violent crime versus an non violent crime. What is being referenced is where no violent crime has taken place and on the word of the accuser a person is sent to jail. So perjury can net a person a long, as in up to a lifetime in jail, where the punishment for perjury when discovered is trivial. No one is arguing that a person should get a light sentence for a violent crime against anyone. Or that the sentences for violent crime and perjury should be the being so big of an unashamed illiterate, that you actually believe shit like this Women receive far lighter sentences for the same type of crime as men across the board in all crime categories excluding none. Women caught committing the exact same crime as a man, ie she is a receive lighter sentences than their male except in rare instances. The more severe the crime where both male and female defendants of the same crime the women will almost invariably receive years less in sentencing. >you have the fact that false rape allegations resulting in convictions aren't a widespread issue in the slightest according to just, well, virtually every credible authority on the subjectThis statement is incorrect. The number of false rape accusations being detected has greatly increased since the hysteria that the rape culture movement created by feminists highlighted that blindly believing an accuser caused more victims to be created. The whole title 9 fiasco where due process was removed from accused highlights the failing in the mentality. As you have pointed out above any legal system worth it salt has due process as a foundation stone of its legal system. Reading through your post history is pretty scary. You are a very angry person as pretty much all your posts revolve around you saying you are not a feminist and yet attacking and insulting anyone you converse with. Reminds me of saying, ""If all the world is full of assholes is it the world or you?""Anyways most of what you wrote above is based on your assumption that violent crimes and perjury should be looked at the same.

"Yes, I know it's free online. What I'm trying to communicate, via hyperbole, is that much of the coverage by pro journalists has been misguided in focusing on 16/206 negative that were identified and described as Russian Trolls. And that this is out of around 1000 total ""analyzed"" tweets. My own digging has been focused on that angle too, and this linked article also focuses on the Russian Trolls angle, because that's what the misguided other journos were getting wrong.Most other GGers that would come and comment on an AMA thread have no idea what the study actually is looking at, or can describe why the methodology or analysis is wrong. We can all point at the journos who reported on the study WRONG, but we'd find ourselves in agreement with the researcher on that front. The angle you pointed out is something pretty interesting that I hadn't considered. Whether further study would separate the tweets into ""pre-GG"" and ""post-GG"" engagement. To me, it's obvious that there's something meaningful to be gleaned from the study about ""see, this is why you don't gather tweets in this manner and look at them in complete isolation completely manually"", but how much of that will be discussed civilly with the the author compared to how many of us will just call him a liberal shill for his study on Muh Russian Hackers?Who's going to just have all the proof they need on hand? I don't know. Maybe this dude has literally never ever been on the bad side of twitter and can't make meaningful casual observations that are super obvious to degenerates like me or the author of this piece: >Just from using the platform casually, in my experience tagging people in Twitter is pretty uncommon and ""@-ing"" someone is a method of communication used by trolls who get their kicks knowing that you get a notification of their message. The average Twitter user tweets something like ""I don't like Star Wars,"" the average troll tweets ""@rianjohnson you ruined my childhood you overrated hack.""It would be pretty embarassing to see him get completely and casually btfo by us and our degenerately deep knowledge of our community, but I think he's more likely to find a bunch of idiots who haven't/can't read, but have already formed a misguided opinion based on the misguided ... Thinking back on it, the ""know you're gay"" is also a super casual BTFO for anyone who has actually read it.

"Batman use to kill under Bob Kane until the early 40s when the PTA fainting couch types said ""Superhoes shouldn't kill"". He originally was written to leave KGBeast to die in the tunnels after their fight in 1988 (Batman #420), it's only later retconning by another writer that says KGBeast was later rescued. And in Batman 425 he allows a mobster to be crushed by a pile of car. So Yeah I don't see a as to the idea ""it'd practically not the same character"" it kind of isn't, if you read venom now, he's got very little hatred or love for spider-man it is almost understood as a ""you leave me alone, I leave you alone"" which started in lethal protector where Venom actually upholds a deal not be a jackass and be a hero in the west coast if Spider-man leaves him alone. The villainous venom you're thinking of is similar to how Bob Kane originally wrote batman, it was there it exist but isn't the character how he has been for 25 of the 30 years he's existed, that villainous ""WE HATE SPIDER-MAN SO MUCH"" venom is actually minority of the stories for him.Read ""Edge of the Venomverse"" it specifically explores ""what if alternate versions of other heroes got the symboite"" witout it touching peter as far as the story says.",0

And as if that weren't bad enough the parasitic little have the audacity to demand that they be able to peruse a menu and pick which dickhole they prefer to infest. It's fucking ridiculous. I pay money to a content creator to fund his work, and the site leeches their cut off the top. That's how the game works, and I'm cool with that. Gotta pay if you want to play. But something's clearly and inherently broken when these modern day pharisees cut into their own profits to prevent a perfectly legal transaction between a willing buyer and a willing seller. These are the types of things that drive men to take drastic measures. There's a miasmatic aura of frustration and anger lurking just below the surface of polite day-to-day discourse in this country. (U.S. I won't speak for the rest of the west, though I suspect this is true elsewhere) The fact that the myriad bad actors on the left seem dead set on hacking through the last handful of threads holding our collective decency together is honestly highly concerning to me.

"Well, women's rights activists are persecuted sometimes to the point of murder in some parts of the world. Rural areas of Pakistan, Afghanistan or Salafi-run places like Saudi Arabia. I don't think there can really can be dispute of that - though it is also true of many different kinds of activists for many different kinds of freedoms or other political and social goals in these same places. Also, calling those women's rights activists ""feminists"" and their adversaries is not always accurate, as feminism is an explicit ideological position with a rich theoretical foundation (whatever any individual may personally think of that foundation) and not simply any effort to make things less shitty for women. So I suspect that's what they are getting at, but I also do think it's important to not allow feminists in the west to claim the glory by proxy of serious political actors in other parts of the world by simply hanging their label on them unchallenged when it may not be accurate.",0

And honestly I don't see anything wrong with either men or women watching someone's boobs or ass or bulge because that's exactly why you showcase it wearing cleavage, tight jeans or other revealing clothes. And the comparison is valid because constantly having degrading songs hit number one is a much bigger problem than watching someone's cleavage. You know shit is wrong when you have literal songs about rape, about cheating on your girlfriend, about objectifying women and so on being so mainstream and normalized. Men are getting blacklisted for being disgusting, rapey and grabbing asses and tits, and Ellen isn't doing anything like that so fuck off. Plus Katy does seem comfortable with it. If she wasn't okay with it it would be different but she's obviously cool with it.

"So, I take the time to answer your question as thoroughly as I can and you respond by going off on a tangent about how the SCOC didn't do their job SCOC case was about whether Khadr's rights were violated. I am no lawyer but I don't think the scope of their job included trying to figure out how Khadr ended up fighting for the enemy as a 15yo. Despite what your (and my) knee-jerk response is, he was a minor at this time. I believe that the SCOC ruling is fair.The debate about whether Khadr was radicalized by his family or not is an entirely separate subject. The debate over whether he should have been considered a child soldier or not is another entirely separate subject. His family ties and history is irrelevant to the SCOC ruling and to the eventual settlement. You can't choose to ignore a person's rights based on family history or you like it or not, Khadr was a minor when all of this happened. I don't know if you have children, but I do, and having raised a few teenagers and am in the process of raising a few more I can fully understand how a child can look and mostly act like a adult yet not have the mind nor ability to fully think as one. This is a fact that a lot of people forget about teenagers. Especially if Khadr's family is as you describe, Khadr may have not had much of a chance to do the right thing due to his upbringing. I know I sure as hell would never have sent my 15 to a war zone to act as a translator. That's probably the biggest WTF in all of this.In a way I rather like that the US immediately tried to find a way to gain access to Khadr's settlement in order to help not only Speer's family, but also Morris, who was wounded. I think it's rather telling how there was no suit mentioned until there was blood in the water, so to speak. Seeking justice would have been filing suit against Khadr and his parents whether there was $10.5M on the table or not; Much like Canada's settlement with Khadr, there was no suit filed until it made financial sense. ""Justice"" isn't this nuanced.I retract my statements about Harper being your guy; Most people here think that Harper was flawless and that Bernier is some kind of political messiah. As I said in my original post in this thread, there are a lot of things to slag Trudeau over, but this $10.5M settlement is not one of them.

I would have to talk to one of them to find out what it means to themUsing your ignorance as a stand-in for understanding is not the same as being informed; it is the opposite. People who do not understand an issue yet feel confident that they are correct are fools in the most classical sense of the word.I was not attempting to educate. I was attempting to shed light on ignorance. It is too fucking easy to educate yourself for you to put the ""burden of proof"" on anyone but yourself unless you're in a debate setting. If you are ignorant in 2018 with a smartphone in your pocket it's because you CHOOSE to be that way. ""Read a book"" is a phrase I use to let people know that it's obvious that they do not take the time to consider the perspectives of others (and to belittle them because I value being informed and belittle those who are uninformed). Because once you've read a book by a person who believes things that you don't believe you immediately realize that your viewpoint isn't worth shit compared to the reality that we collectively experience.I spent 2 sec to google [""non-binary person and here's just one of 10 million results. If you want to sit through a poorly-edited highly-slanted view of events I'm sure Buzzfeed has made a dozen youtube videos about nonbinary people.

"Except people are complaining all the fucking time about the arbitrary exercise of moderator discretion in every other subreddit. Why do you think KIA has an explicit prohibition against ""Dear Diary, today I was banned from REEEEEE"" posts? Because that was literally one of the many random things this sub was flooded with at one point. The point system was proposed by KIA community members as a solution to the problem of KIA mods having arbitrary discretion over how they enforced the rules and not making it clear what is and isn't against the rules. The mods basically said ""heres a thread, guys, feel free to come up with the best system to fix this problem"" and the point system was just that.The KIA mod team are among the only subreddits in the history of this website who took complaints of moderator transparency and discretion seriously enough to make their rules regarding what is and isn't on topic as explicit and transparent as possible, and host regular feedback and voting threads in response to criticism. Few other subs anywhere remotely this size have mod teams who give two shits about people getting ""unfairly"" banned.Since as it turns out, for every 1 person with a legitimate point there are 100 trolls with throbbing hateboners who will find literally any reason to complain about anything. Case in point, an explicit and transparent system telling you exactly what the rules are in clear and no uncertain terms and even allowing you to completely ignore them by making a self-post still isn't enough to forestall this latest round of ""ermagerd mods r nazis"" bitching.As far as I can tell, every mod team gets so fucking jaded dealing with this cancer on a daily basis that they just give up entirely. Which probably explains why all the people who end up as supermods either hate the reddit userbase, are fucking insane, or both. They do it for free, after all.So yes, in a way you've got a point: the point system is probably moronic and pointless. It was established to increase transparency and reduce arbitrary discretion, but as it turns out the people who were complaining about that in the first place won't be satisfied with anything anyways.",0

(In the few publications *that* [showed up that the ""trolls"" were all feminists, and well known ""tumblr personalities"" as well, is never brought up)It was kind of a fascinating rabbit hole to crawl down, seeing the absolutely *seething* hatred feminism (who you might think would welcome such a development) had out for MLP fans since the beginning, usually the most bonafide diagnosable autistic kids too (for some reason white upper class/college educated feminists are *immensely* triggered by encountering mentally ""different"" men and boys, despite all their talk of ""fighting ableism""), damn shame I didn't know about archive.is at the time, because it really needed documentation as a ""proto-gg Internet drama."" All this -ist, -ist, -ist coordinated shaming being the only mention they got at places like Ms and and In fact [they hit the ground floor of gg before gg was even It's a real shame I could only come across screenshots and recollections by people after the fact, because I feel like an essential part of the setup for the revolt against the media both in 2014 and 2016 has gone missing.

If a woman is about to have sex some incredible dude that she’s smitten by and he goes “oh btw I used to be woman, now I have a penis” she has just as much a right to say no.

The we listen to people who we know agree with us, and don't listen to others we know don't agree with us is a mental shortcut, a heuristic.

Outside of that the *most* you can find is the cat’s name in *The Rats in the Walls*, and a few references to “mongrel” folk peppered in other stories or usage of words like “negro” (outside of his rather infamous poem *On the Creation of Niggers*).

Actually not at allYou sound easily convinced so I trust you'll take my word for it,0
">So by your logic...Actually that's not my logic, but good job for the attempt. My logic is that when a word is defined by it's lawlessness it is inaccurate to use it when the event was lawful. Let's go through your examples:>unarmed black man was murdered because by definition, the state has a monopoly on force?Actually, it would be that the killing was unlawful in the first place for whatever reasons that are relevant to this event (e.g. complying with understandable police direction, being a bystander, etc.) If it was a lawful killing then they are wrong.>An anti war activist cannot say that civilians were murdered because civilian casualties are not blanket prohibited by the international laws regarding warfare?Considering killing civilians is [protected by international laws regarding this is a moot point.>Can we say OJ Simpson murdered his wifeYou can considering the reason why legal cases are resolved through the judgement ""Not guilty"" instead of and double jeopardy laws suddenly render his slayings legal?No. Primarily because the case could still be tried federally, and thus would not satisfy a logically consistent definition of legal that requires the possibility of an acquittal verdict being the necessary action to render an event legal that was previously illegal for going to trial.Though ultimately you're wrong because of your inclusion of ""cannot"" without any qualifiers. I never said or suggested anything of the sort. I said you're wrong to use the wrong word and should instead use a different one.After all, each of these events are indeed killings. So in any event where what was stated is indeed true, they would still be killings despite their inherent legality.",0

Canada could have tried to strip him of citizenship but didn’t. Canada could have refused to interrogate him knowing he’d been tortured.

To be precise, approximately 3.05% of boys and approximately 1.57% of girls would have an IQ of 130 or higher in this model.These differences would grow wider as one gets farther from the mean. For example, using the same model as the previous paragraph, one would expect more than six times as many boys as girls with an IQ of 160 or higher.So no, men's intelligence is on average higher, and also more broad.

I fully get it that women to level false rape charges are despicaple. Those women should face severe charges for that. They should reap what they sow. You can’t use the law as a weapon and file false charges. I also agree that women who engage in wiling sexual behavior after drinking and regret it is very differ than predatory behavior when a woman in plied with alcohol or slipped drugs.

He hasn't denied her that but the nature of that relationship has been altered by her own actions. He has no legally or morally, to lie to his children to protect his cheating ex-wifes feelings.Its not surprising that the kids hate her. When you cheat you violate a trust. You turn your back on a promise you made to a person you said you loved in front of your entire family and God. You violated the trust of the person you claimed to love with all your heart. Obviously the kids are mad and don't trust her. How do they know her relationship with them is real? She already betrayed one person she loved.

"> Arctangent - there are things in this world that are worth getting into a fiery shitstorm about. There's also things that clearly are not. This qualifies as the latter. When you hold views, you are creating more problems than you are solving. This was a bunch of dust that did not need to be kicked up, but you went and did it anyway - and for what? I apologize if this is a real issue for you and I do not mean to offend you, but you also have to look at the bigger picture here. The world is nuanced, and as long as you continue seeing it in black and white you become just as despicable as the very people who have originally made this such a horrible issue as it is in the first place today. Extremists are extremists - period. It doesn't matter if they're ""far right"" or ""far left"" - no matter what views they hold, the EXTREMISM is the issue, not the values they believe that they hold dear.> In the future, when you find yourself starting to do what you have quite literally become famous for doing - take a step back, breathe a little bit, and come back a little bit more calm. People aren't as evil as you try to make them out to be.> Further thoughts: Honestly I believe that both sides of the issue is nothing more than a dick stroking contest to see who is ""morally superior"" - I'll give you a little hint: no one is! Not when you act like THAT, anyway! And also - you attacked someone who is VERY much against extreme religious crap that a lot of people try to pull - and who could've been an ally and an advocate for you on this issue - but instead of trying to see from his you forced him on the defensive immediately and lost him completely on the issue. When you do that, you're not helping your cause at all - you're pushing people AWAY from it. You're being belligerent for no real reason, and in the end, it hurts your issue more than it helps it.Well put. Arctangent kept calling everyone who disagreed with itself ""giant pieces of shit"", which is since that told me it was the bigger piece of shit.",1

"> Actress Keira Knightley went on the Ellen Degeneres show on Tuesday and said that her daughters are banned from watching Cinderella and The Little Mermaid, why? Because she wants her daughters to know she doesn’t need no man…no really. She stated that those films send the message that women should wait for a handsome prince to rescue them or that women should give up everything for a you know, she waits around for a rich guy to rescue her. Don’t! Rescue yourself, she fucking doesn’t watch the damn takes her fate and life into her own hands and sells her voice for legs to go get the man she wants. Eric doesn’t save Ariel from *shit* — she saves *him* from drowning and then wants his dick. Stuff happens on land, Ariel breaks the agreement, and then Ursula takes Ariel captive per the terms of their contract, but King Triton — Ariel’s *father* — offers himself in her place, and then Eric and Ariel *work together* to kill Ursula and save Triton and the world.Keira Knightley is banning her daughter from watching a movie that features a female protagonist who retains complete agency for almost the entire movie and directly drives 100% of the action because she herself has evidently not seen the movie and knows nothing about it. The core message of Disney’s adaptation of The Little Mermaid is that pursuing your dreams is *hard as fuck* and any number of things can go disastrously wrong — including things that will be *your own fault* for trusting the wrong people or taking the wrong approach — but that if you don’t take on that risk and that then your chance of achieving your goals is movie didn’t kick off the Disney Renaissance by being shitty or backwards, it did it because its themes resonate at a fundamental archetypal level. It’s teaching you a lesson you’ve always known but that you forgot, one that’s equally vital to anyone and everyone regardless of identity group. It’s a great movie and fuck you for denying it to your kids.> Disney cartoons are not supposed to teach your teach life lessonsThe best ones do teach you life lessons, they just do it subtly and almost subject to (well okay Zootopia’s aggressively unsubtle but it’s still very thoughtful about its subject matter and is still chiefly telling a story first before teaching a lesson).

That's not how statistics work! Honestly, I feel bad for these people. They seem to honestly think that our culture condones rape. I'd be pretty nettled too, if I believed that. I'd probably be rather stressed out all the time if I lived in the Middle East. The argument that makes sense is that sometimes protect rapists because of the status of the rapist. But the thing that people miss is that *everyone hates when do this*. It's not like a college protects it's star running back and everyone's like ""welp, all's well that ends well."" No, people lose their fucking minds! People still talk about *Brock Turner* because he got off too easy on a rape charge. People ought to start asking college kids what needs to be done to eliminate rape culture, so that we could get better insight into what they think it is.

I've been told I'm because I don't like doing one night stands and I like sex more for emotional reasons (feeling close to someone, feeling loved and love the feeling of caring for a man) than I do physical reasons. Been told I'm fluid because I think some heterosexual erotica is hot. I've been told I'm an ""otter"" because I'm hairy but am too slim to be a ""bear"". Been called a ""stone butch"" because I fall on the more masculine end of the spectrum, prefer to be the dominant partner, and love taking care of my boyfriends. It's just stupid. Date who you like, wear whatever clothes you like, do your hair however you like, have or don't have sex, etc. Stop thinking every little thing needs a label. Also, kind of a side note, I just want to say how interesting it is how many of these people I see say ""not interested in cis straight men"". As far as I know, there's no inherent physical differences between straight, gay, or bisexual cis men, so it's clearly a political thing (trying to undermine cis straight guys), not an actual sexual preference.

At this point now (contrary to what Brad and his cronies are claiming), Fred & Paul can't even *start* working on their true sequel because they've got this lawsuit hanging over their head, and the settlement offer from Stardock says outright that they're literally never allowed to make another Star Control game again as long as they live.If Star Control: Origins is being review bombed, I can essentially guarantee you that that's the reason. The vast majority of the fan community would like to see both Star Control games, and many of us decided not to purchase Origins because of this ridiculous lawsuit*.",1

"Forgive me, it's late, and I haven't slept.The BanOut: 2018 initiative targeted racist right wing subreddits to shut them down. The questions are: 1: What constitutes as racist, as there is a legitimate problem with the left calling those that don't agree with them racists, or even citing factual accredited statistics as racist.2: Were any anti-white, or other racist pages or accounts targeted? Is there a list available of the subs and users targeted by BanOut so that we can go see for ourselves what the racist content was that warranted banning?The fact that this BanOut initiative goes *at least* all the way to upper management in Reddit staff, Director of Policy at Reddit, Jessica Ashooh, who comes from a pretty questionable background in this instance; so that means that Reddit in some regards supports this initiative, and being they're a left leaning site, that's concerning, but not all that coupled with you ""contacted a certain admin to let him/her know what I was going to do."" This admin who also works for left leaning Reddit, gave you the go ahead to troll the BanOut initiative to get it shut down. Which is kind've a funny thing to do for someone who legitimately believes the pages and accounts Ban:Out were targeting legitimately were racist.My theory I posit here, is that this was all an inside job to erase evidence and connections of Reddit staff and others to BanOut: 2018, as nothing changed besides the centralized hub and all evidence of BanOut was destroyed. Everything (pertaining to my questions above about what constitutes as racism) that was targeted and banned by BanOut is still banned. No subs have been restored, no users reinstated. BanOut is still very much active, but now it is invisible, and every connection to those who participated in it, and everything they (potentially falsely) deemed racist has been erased.

So then they give a bunch of incentives for Canadians to switch into the industry, a bunch of training programs spring up which barely have anything to do with the actual work in the industry causing a bunch of Canadians to switch careers for something better.

"For those who don't know, ""JourneyQuest"" is the name of an indie film series put out by Zombie Orpheus Entertainment, who are also the producers (I think it's producers) of the ""Gamers"" films (i.e. ""The Gamers"" ""The Gamers: Dorkness Rising"" and ""The Gamers: Hands of Fate""), though I believe they didn't become affiliated with the Gamers movies until the second or third such feature. The actual production company that makes the movies is [Dead Gentlemen think. The exact nature of how the two companies are related doesn't seem to be entirely clear (that I can find with some casual Googling).What *is* clear is that in the last few films, the content that they produce has started to take on SJW overtones. I know some people here [didn't like the last Gamers because of perceived SJW-isms, something that I [disagreed at the time.Unfortunately, it's gotten worse since then. ""Gamers Zero"" and ""The Gamers: The Shadow Menace"" (the former being a collection of shorts, leading into the latter film) went full-retard in their support for social justice. Several points include:* Magellan, a wizard who comes to Earth from the fantasy world of Fartherall (and promptly gives himself amnesia), unconsciously uses his magic to influence events in the 21st century. These include his causing the housing crash of 2008, coining the ""ethics in game journalism"" line, and encouraging Trump to run for President.* A new group of gamers includes an openly gay fat guy, who objects strongly to playing Rogar as being straight, despite Rogar being an existing character who is firmly established as being heterosexual. This results in Rogar seducing two male guards during a heist.* An Asian female member of that new group angrily objects to a comment someone else makes that she thinks is ""casual misogyny"" (I can't remember what the comment was).* A black guy in the new group is implied to have had a recent encounter with racist members of law enforcement. Because of this, he has Nimble (a white character) openly say (when he meets some enemies during a nighttime encounter) ""Greetings, fellow white people! Isn't it grand that I, as a white man, can encounter you here at night and *not* have my presence be construed as inherently threatening?""* Another member of that group, a white girl who is implied to be a lesbian, gets upset at the idea of The Shadow (the campaign's ultimate enemy) having kidnapped a princess, remarking that the trope was old when Super Mario Bros. did it, and that the princess should rescue herself. (She then has egg all over her face when she's told that ""Princess"" is the name of the five year-old daughter of another member of her party.)In short, the newest productions in the ongoing Gamers/JourneyQuest series (the two series share the same universe) seem to be going full socjus.

">The project involves studying female engineering professors to ""lend critical insights into the divide"" that results in fewer women entering science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) programs.STEM field subjects don't appeal to women at a base level, and don't appeal to the vast majority of the general public at that same base level. This is because they require a level of scholastic preparation and understanding that is far above what the average person desires to spend, to the point that people who enjoy them consistently showcase similar symptoms to autism. There, I saved you half a mil; the NSF should've sent the check to me.Seriously, the verdict on the 'Women in STEM' argument has been available for years now, and the bottom line is that STEM shit just doesn't appeal to the vast majority of people, including the vast majority of women. It's hours upon hours of memorizing formulas and rote material, constant testing to ensure knowledge retention, and repetition ad infinitum. Yeah, anyone can go into STEM and learn it, but as someone part of it, while I would like to see more of anyone in the club, the journey fucking sucks. If you want more people in STEM, the education methodology needs to be rebuilt from the ground up, starting with Mathematics as it's the ultimate framework for the rest of the group, and then moving on from there. Good luck, however, getting old hats to change what clearly works in favor of appeasing the up-and-comers who tend to be self-centered and lazy.>The study seeks to upend current engineering and computer science programs by educating students and faculty on the ""benefits of diversity and required to foster welcoming environments for women.""Then this is not a study. A study collects and analyzes data, that's it. It isn't designed to push changes on its own; such action is supposed to be for those who wish to interpret the data that way. It's almost like this anthropologist is barely a legitimate professor and has no idea what her job is supposed to be (hint: it's not forcing personal ideologies on others for the sake of being able to give yourself a back-pat).>Due to the prominence and impact of ECS [engineering and computer science], identifying gender inequities in the field and interrupting them will help welcome and retain more talented women from a range of intersectional identitiesThe assumption that all women are talented, because that is what is being implied here, is beyond retarded and speaks to the general societal sentiment that too many people have been coddled into thinking they are This just in: you don't. Nobody matters until they make the personal decision to leave behind some kind of legacy. Such a thing is not a 'given', it's an 'earned', and had these people had parents who pushed them to compete via some means, they would've learned vectors of gender.""What an hilarious statement. Not only does this just sound ridiculous when you read it, because it's obviously the result of a stupid person using big words to sound intelligent, but anyone who has a decent vocabulary knows that the term 'vector' relates to pathogens and disease transmission, resulting in a statement that rounds down to 'intersecting diseases of gender'.>If anything, at least they aren't giving a lot of money for someone to study so... that's an improvement I guess?Perhaps, but the organization is still pissing away over half a million dollary-doos that's going to result in a highly-biased result that is woefully inadequate, confusing to parse, and rushed. What would have been a better expenditure would've been to host some sort of scholarship contest for kids entering into college involving some research project, where said students would have to produce a finalized report and analysis (properly supervised, of course). That way, you immediately separate the wheat from the chaff and find out not only who wants to go to college for STEM, but you also give young kids an exposure to real academic work to see if they want to actual make a career out of studying and testing. This gives them a chance to test the waters, rather than forcing them to make the decision in the middle of their transition and far more difficult undergraduate course work or, god forbid, at the start of their graduate course work because the college they went to didn't have enough funding to start proper academic research projects for undergrads.Or, shit, just donate it to an up-and-coming or buy a bunch of supplies and auction them off to programs that need them. Fuck, anything would be better than giving money that belongs to the sciences to a fucking humanities professor that unironically teaches shit like 'Queer Anthropology', as if the ancient human races spent any time coming up with statements like, 'Hmm, I woke up on the left side of the bed today, so I guess I'm a demi-gender pan-deersexual who has a penis, but that's hidden inside me and manifests itself via a vagina'.",1

"Cop here: I also was suspicious of the 2%-10% claim. I’ve dozens of sexual assault allegations and I can remember a handful that were true.I have absolutely had some true ones and it’s hard to explain, but I can usually tell pretty quickly when those are because the woman acts differently (and not how you’d expect). More so than how they act (I’ve had some [real] sexual assault victims act very quiet, or very sad, or very mad) but mainly their stories make sense.The false ones that I’ve just don’t make sense and it’s blatantly obvious. The timelines don’t make sense, big plot points change, suspect description changes, or the suspect has definitive proof of the lie.I’ve commented on a case of mine before where when I talked to the suspect he showed me texts from the night in question from the “victim” saying no one could find out about them hooking up or her boyfriend would hear.Well the boyfriend heard and when I showed her the texts (from her to “suspect”) she just apologized and got up to leave the room (like that was going to be the end of it). Taking her to jail was very satisfying. Cops still should have due diligence to investigate all claims like they are true. I have sisters, a mother, and a wife and if some cop blew off a real assault I’d be furious. But IF the report is proven false, that person needs to go to jail.

I welcomed them exactly the same as I have any other person that has sat at my table. I give them the same shot and let them live and die on whether or not they act like twats.I've never had a problem with sexism or diversity in my games, and I'm in the midwest. The only time I've ever had issue is when 2 local art college snobs that changed their genders and descriptors on a whim started a group we joined. After a series of 'magical realm' issues, censorship on what we could say (Except the DM), inserting rants pre- and post-game, and a round of 'Can we go around and announce our pronouns' followed by 'and now food allergies' I was done. Those people were twats. I especially loved the 'Genderfluid Queer DM that shouted down our active gay players, viewing it as a sort of oppression olympics. Also; 'Try not to be triggering, but here's my OC... a rape baby who needs to murder her family' Again, those people were twats. And I stuck around for a year before taking our best players and becoming a forever DM.",1

This makes 1st worlders harder to control and harder to oppress than 3rd worlders, since 3rd worlders are used to being controlled/oppressed by the state, and 1st worlders aren't.

">A Warr Acres woman is accused of taking more than $450,000 from a man with Alzheimer's disease when she was supposed to be taking care of him.>Going back as far as 2011So she has been doing this for 7 years.>After gaining power of attorney over him, police say Smith-Frawner began by deeding his Warr Acres home over to herself via quitclaim deed for just $1.What the to court documents, she added herself to his bank account and, in 2015, started making withdrawals and writing herself checks. These include a $77,229.28 cashier's check ""used to pay off a BancFirst loan in the name of Cindy Smith in 2015."" Another was a withdrawal posted to the victim's account in October 2017 in the amount of $29,371.86. That was a payment ""made to Honda Financial to pay off a 2016 Honda Accord that was registered to Cindy Smith."">The documents allege that in August of 2017, a $10,000 cashier's check from the victim's account went to Emerald Springs Spas ""for a down payment on a hot tub"" that was set up at residence. The total price of the hot tub and accessories was $14,489.10. Smith-Frawner also took out a loan for the remaining balance from the Oklahoma Educator's Credit Union, then a month later, $4,682.39 was taken out of the victim's account to pay off a loan at the Oklahoma Educator's Credit Union.>Then, in October 2017, $295,000 was transferred from the victim's bank account to her personal account, one the victim did not have access say the total equaled over $450,000. They note that that number does not include other suspicious transactions, the value of the house she allegedly did not pay for and a Chevy Avalanche that belonged to the is accused of taking most of the Navy veteran's life savings, and leaving him a little more than $40,000.>We did, however, speak to her attorney, Billy Bock, who insists the man cared for Smith-Frawner like a daughter, and knew about the was done under his wishes,"" Bock said. ""I understand he doesn't remember that now and it's sad. I wish he did.>My client did not knowingly deceive or defraud or take money away from [him] in any way other than what his wishes are,"" Bock said.This lawyer sounds scummy at penalties could include 37 years in prison and $85,000 in fines.This is all. This is bs. She will not get the max. My guess is she will get less than 10 years. So steal $600,000+ and only have to pay back $85,000.I am guessing the house was worth more than $100,000 dollars.So the $450,000 + other transactions not included in the $450,000 + $100,000+ house = say the total equaled over $450,000.

This puts him in an awkward predicament where he'll treat people like garbage and then feel bad about it later. So he does the typical and states the problem isn't with *him*, but with *men in general*. You see, now it's suddenly not his fault. He now suddenly feels a whole lot better about himself.

He martyrs himself in the least committed and most half-assed way possible, and then tells us all how great he is for it. He tells other men that he, a woke male ally, is what all men should strive to be. Yeah. He's not the first male feminist with this M.O. to come out of the woodwork and attempt to shine the light on men. Just once I want to see a male feminist *actually* admit to what it is that's weighing him down so much.

"> while Gamergate is fine with women who ‘just want to play games’ and don’t challenge their perception of video games, their implications, or anything outside of the gameplay, they see most women as being suspicious, or at least interlopers into an essentially male space (Vermeulen, Van Bauwel, & Van Looy,2017; Euteneur, 2016; Robinson, 2014). Because they believe that gender is an essentialist trait, a woman who does want to play video games will still likely want to feminize them to make it more comfortable for women to play. Gamergate mostly wants women or at least anything that carries feminine traits to stay away from video games, which they have constructed as an essentially masculine space. Wat.",1

"If this person found D&D so off-putting because of how the races separated themselves from each other, then it doesn't make sense for him to also be a huge fan of Tolkien's work. The different races in Tolkien's world barely tolerate each other, only cooperating when their literal existence is at stake. Elves live in their forests and shun travelers, and eventually altogether leave the world en masse because they find Middle Earth unbearable. Dwarves hole up in their mountains and lock the doors, eventually dying when something more powerful than them shows up to take their stuff. Men are either self-assured that they have no need of the other races, or are too busy trying to make a living to worry about other races. Orcs, trolls, goblins, and the like exist to fulfill their own primal needs of hunger, conquest, and bloodshed; for them, the good races exist only to be slaughtered, enslaved, and eaten.And the Hobbits want nothing to do with any of them.Most D&D settings are going to naturally be more homogenous than Tolkien's Middle Earth. I don't think that's a good or a bad thing, just that it is. But for this Tolkien enthusiast to pretend like he turned away from D&D simply because of how the races were segregated is absolutely absurd.",1

The blowback from that will be so angry that the normies actually get really mad and start hurting people. Then and only then will the remaining non-progressive Democratic establishment disown the leftists, and the Dems will have to completely reform into something new. The moral panic of social justice will end before 2022, but not without more than a few dead bodies if the Dems have a marginal win. I think at this point a blue or red wave would actually be better in both cases because a blue wave would put the left-corporatist establishment back in charge, and a red wave would make the democratic establishment re-consider their approach early.Social Justice can not survive long term because it is an ideology that is to tribalistic to maintain its ""intersectional"" coalition of racial and sexual identitarians.

You could maybe make case of SEED's ZAFT being such a case due to taking heavy inspiration from MSG Zeon but it also have some differences that make such claims harder to make. Gundam X's Space Revolutionary Army could be stretched to maybe fit due to again taking inspiration from Zeon but the series don't really focus much time on that faction so it's hard to know.I don't think you find such state in G, Wing, Turn A or 00, maybe cases could be made for AGE, Reconguista in G or Iron-Blooded Orphans I haven't completed them so I don't know but even if so that still plenty of series that lack such states which makes saying ""almost always"" a bit much.>Legend of the Galactic Heroes, a Japanese novel series adapted into multiple anime shows, also contains a similar government called the Galactic Empire.I wouldn't say the Galactic Empire is primarily inspired by a WWII-era Germany but rather 19 century Prussia or the German Empire with the focus on how important nobility is to advance in the ranks of the Galactic Empire. >Hetalia: Axis Powers portrays a group of countries with a sympathetic, Germany as the main character.

"I assume you're talking about US history (and leaving aside the gross and murderous injustices of the slave system, which is a book in of itself). Is she aware that voting rights for white men once involved property restrictions? Just as a random example, in Rhode Island in the 1830s, unpropertied men raised a militia and there was violence (Dorr Rebellion). It took decades before property restrictions were lifted for men. It was a slow and unsexy process, so your GF has probably never heard of it.There were plenty of men's rebellions against economic injustices. Ever heard of Shays' Rebellion? Broke out right after the American Revolution in western mainly poor farmers. Whiskey Rebellion? Poor farmers in western Pennsylvania had one item they could sell-- whiskey-- and the government put a tax on whiskey which was burdensome on them. They were not spared taxation because they were men. How about the Anti-Rent War in upstate NY? Poor farmers revolted against a kind of semi-feudal landlord system in the Hudson river valley.Is she aware of labor history? The US had a very violent labor history in the 1800s. Working people men) clamored for things like a 40 hour work week and weekends off. Does your girlfriend like having the weekend off? I assume she does. Does she think male capitalists freely gave their male workers days off *because they were men?* Did she read the book ""The Jungle""? Jurgis isn't exactly living high on the hog for most of the book.If you do your homework, you'll see that rights and benefits were never gifted out to common men, *qua men.* There was often a struggle involved. Powerful men do not favor less powerful men. The factory owner is more likely to spend his money on a fur coat for the wife than parcel out benefits to the men on the factory floor. This isn't rocket the leaders of the early women's movement at Seneca Falls were all comfortably middle class (at least) and had support from their husbands (oh *and servants,* they sometimes had servants too). For instance, Elizabeth Cady Standon and Lucretia Mott met at an antislavery conference in London; their husbands had paid for their tickets. It is a bit rather hard to claim that you're oppressed when your husband not only buys your steamship tickets across the Atlantic but *also* helps you to organize the first women's rights conference because you had no experience organizing conferences before.

That was the first large group of women in human history to have free time. Consider the significance of that.",1

">“CERN considers the presentation delivered by an invited scientist during a workshop on >##**High Energy Theory and Gender**>as highly offensive,” CERN said in a Sept. 30 comments also received massive backlash from a large group of particle physicists in the form of a letter on a site titled >##**“[Particles for (above link is to archive.is)from ParForJus:>Strumia argues that it is actually men who experience discrimination, since they are more likely to serve in wars and be used as forced labor. While many talented people of all genders still face barriers due to war and conflict, these concerns are not part of the experience of the majority of white male physicists born and raised in Europe or North America in the current era. He also misquotes the Istanbul convention as saying that men cannot be discriminated against, when the actual text is that ""special measures that are necessary to prevent and protect women from gender‐based violence shall not be considered discrimination under the terms of this Convention.""

Conversely, some argue that fake child porn could be an outlet that prevents someone else from harming a real child because they can ""safely"" live out a harmful fantasy.In the same way, an argument could be made that someone who gets off on raping sex robots could be just practicing and then feel emboldened enough to try the real thing.

It's insulting for both the audience and especially for the forced diversity hire in a desperate attempt to virtue signal how ""progressive"" they are by race swapping and shoving some token black chick.The rest of the cast are as generic, boring and bland as they can be. Don't really think that Henry Cavill could carry the show on his own. And let's be honest, he might be charismatic and one of the most handsome men alive, but his acting abilities are somewhere between that of a cucumber and a chair. Seriously disappointed with the cast. I might be wrong, who knows, they may turn out to be the next Game of Thrones (the first 3 seasons) out of nowhere and the costume & make up department may be able to pull it off.

"Mark Hamill is a really good example of how, oftentimes, the man matters far more than the message, which is to say, who you hear something from matters more than what you hear. I, too, openly question some of the views he expresses on twitter, like many of you on this forum. But you know what? it doesn't really matter. It doesn't matter if he and I don't agree on anything with regards to politics, if the man himself is so obviously full of integrity and his views don't really matter, I'll listen to what he has to say. That's the real trick, if its Anita Sarkessian, it doesn't matter what the message is. If she did a video on the long term benefits of flossing, I'd probably skip picking up floss the next time I'm at the drug store and might question the very foundation of dental hygiene as a science. The messenger often matters as much, if not more so, than the message. If Anita says it, I'm not listening, period. If Alexandria promotes something in a campaign stop, I'm going to assume its dumb, stupid and naïve and not give it a serious thought. Those people can't get through to me. If Tim Poole says it, then even if I disagree with it, he has more than enough credibility with me that I'll think about it, do some research and try to figure out where he's coming from. Hamill is one of those guys. I disagree with him on plenty, but he has a lot of credibility with me. The man is what gets people to pay attention and consider new ideas, the man often matters more than the message.",1

"I don't share your positive outlook. However, I do think that the comparison to the evolution of art in the past two centuries is being mimicked by now, we find ourselves in the era of gaming, where some people are trying to figure out new ways to approach videogame development and playability, but generally speaking most participants are either cynical actors or snotty elitists that think their shit don't stink. And just like with art, we are now seeing the kindling embers of the post movement, with games such as Doom, BoTW, Mario Odyssey, RE7, SoulCalibur VI (and a few others), where the cynicism and corporate bullshit is worn-out, and the people involved just want to make games that core audiences have been begging for years, just updated to modern sensibilities and tech specs.I'm sure you're now asking ""But isn't that good? We're getting rid of the ideologues, right?"", to which I say no, not really. See, left a stain in the art world that will likely NEVER go away. Audiences, be them philistines or not, got it into their heads that being an artist means being a snooty cuntbag sniffing their own farts and making up excuses for pointless drivel. Critics, and the elitists in the art world, have also collectively agreed to circle-jerk that notion around. How's things going for post-post modernists? Not well, because even if their work is appreciated, even if it finds an audience, people just think of it as ""Oh right, classic-style art"", and don't give it any further thought, leaving new creators to either become another cog, or fall into obscurity.Can this be solved? Well, the PPM in art is still going, under 30 years of existance, give or take, and only a FEW videogames fall into the equivalent state. But videogames are much more than Art, so the mediocrity of AAA shlock and the douchecannoes flooding the market will still present a colossal challenge to anyone that doesn't have the backing of a major studio. I mean, Return of the Obra Dinn is kinda PPM, but it still doesn't much going for it, and doesn't seem to have much replay value.",1

This is seen in the report under ""Classification issues.""This is an interesting case when you dig a bit deeper regarding their law. On one hand, I kinda get why they do this because it's a legal issue. The age of the two main characters here are 16 and 15 and this, **correct me if I'm wrong here**, is considered child porn. Although The UK age of consent is 16, The specific issue is that a 16 year old legal is having sexual relations with a 15 year old who is still a “child”, a legal-on-nonlegal depiction. Understandable that they would not want to stick their 2-inch pole in this deep, troublesome hole. On the other hand, the real issue lies with the stupid laws and provisions that are in place. They are drawings. Fictional characters. They are not real ~~just like your waifus~~.Existing for as long as they're drawn. Just because a creator of a work has labelled characters a certain age that should not mean anything. The laws in UK and the general populace mindset regarding this thing need to change as they still treat drawings as having the same rights as a living, breathing, normal people.

Here's a link to a report on how Amnesty International (usually regarded as a liberal organisation) has campaigned against FGM and the treatment of women in Islamic societies. a story about Femen - again definitely a left wing organisation - protesting treatment of women in Islamic societies. you can see it is very easy to prove that the statement ""you'll find zero complaints about Islamic theocracy on today's official ""left"" is nonsense.

Good. I think my biggest issue with these rape accusations is the time in between them. Like 30 fucking years? Get the fuck out of here those type of accusations shouldn't even be looked out without definitive proof. Bottom line if you get raped report it immediately. If you do not report it then it is YOUR fault the rapest doesn't get justice. Also all accusations without definitive proof should be looked at as false untill a thorough investigation is done. The accusations that have only dna and victim testimony as proof should result in both the victim and the accuser being put in lockup while a investigation is done. The victim and suspect should be cross examined Multiple times. This entire investigation should be private period. Any breach of that should result in harsh the penalty for false accusations should be considered a felony and carry at least 2/3s of a rapest sentence.,1

"**Here's a trailer / store review (or personal impression, if you will):** The first contact with your game is through its title and short and they already tell me this is a politically charged game, and that the game takes a clear side in the culture war. At this point, I heavily suspect it will be heavy handed and preachy. My suspicions are reinforced after I start watching the video, as it contains too many ""buzzwords"" which makes it seem like it's a game aimed at die hard anti-SJWs only, and makes it feel too forced. Should be more subtle with these things. The action and the written explanation on the store is not good enough to convey what the gameplay is about to most people. You should show and explain better the game mechanics. If people are confused about your game from the get go, they wont even bother downloading a demo, much less buying it to try and refund if they dislike. The FAQ has a better but most users will not go out of their way and delve into the forum to try and figure out a game whose first impression was ""being weird"", or ""confusing gameplay"".I obviously didnt play the game, but the feeling I get from the material presented is that the SJW theme is just a skin that could be ripped off from the game and it wouldnt change the experience one bit, or even make it better from not feeling so forced or preachy. It feels like an after thought since it doesnt seem like its integrated to the gameplay aspect of the game. You could turn this into an office battle royale themed around office rage and work and it would be all the same, or possibly work better.I don't mean to sound harsh or anything, these are just my personal, unfiltered thoughts from my first contact with the store. In this context, my personal reaction would be to click ""not interested"" and ignore it. Your game is competing for attention with not only thousands of others, but also with the backlog of each steam gamer. Your first battle is to grab the interest of the public to keep looking at your video or reading your Your second one is to aptly convey what your game is all about, how it plays and instill a desire on the user to go out of their way and buy it in a short video and / or As it is, the store lacks hooks and incentives for that. i wish you good luck.",1

"So just to be clear: About 10 million men and teenaged boys died fighting in WW1. The majority of these men didn't have the right to vote, because suffrage in Europe was contingent on property ownership, and most working class men didn't own enough property to be enfranchised. The mountains upon mountains of straight white male corpses propelled the universal suffrage movement to the forefront. Women achieved the vote upon mountains of dead males, both in Europe and the US (see: civil war). Not a single woman had to actually fight for suffrage. She suffered no real risk. She just had to complain to the men in power. And the ""patriarchs"" in government gave women the vote with no conscription obligations (that's not equality, that's chivalry) as soon as the majority said they wanted it. These men and boys, who suffered some of the worst deaths humanly imaginable -- having their guts blown out in trenches and inhaling poison gas, being eaten alive by rats while crucified on barbed wire -- were ""privileged"", according to feminists. A sizable percentage of feminists from the time period actually encouraged men and boys -- who again couldn't vote -- to go die for them in the trenches, to protect female ""honor"" (see white feather campaign). While the suffragists demanded universal suffrage, the suffragettes wanted only rich white women and men to vote. We celebrate the latter, not the former, because the former draw into question feminist mythology [Edit: there were some women from the time period, often described as feminists or who were consistent; eg the American anarchist Emma Goldman (whom I'm quite sure would be appalled by modern feminism) helped mount a legal challenge arguing that conscription was a violation of the 13th Amendment's prohibition against involuntary servitude. The Supreme Court disagreed. Ironically Goldman considered the suffragettes a bunch of spoiled brats, and famously claimed that ""if voting changed anything they'd make it illegal""] Hundreds if not thousands of men were executed on the front lines to prevent desertion, even though historians now agree that many WWI campaigns were useless suicide missions, that the men knew it, and that the ""deserters"" were in the right not to throw their lives away for a patch of mud. In the US, men were imprisoned, tortured and even executed for refusing to fight. These included conscientious objectors from religious groups. (two of these men, Hutterite brothers, were tortured to death at Alcatraz). The majority of American men who fought in WWI were effectively forced to do so. Far more Americans who fought in WWI were conscripted than volunteered. Today, little rich girls who would be living in the gutter without the benefaction of their rich daddies, and living in caves without the benefaction of men as a group, condemn powerless white men and boys from a hundred years ago who died being eaten alive by rats while crying out for their mothers -- because they were white, and male. Yes, this is a perfectly sane society, and feminism is a perfectly sane philosophy. Moreover it encourages ""gender equality."" Honestly, I don't feel hate. I just feel shame and disgust. Shame for what feminism has done to this society, and disgust for both the men and women who have allowed this to happen.",1

Yet I saw men in here who allowed their hate for one person to actually be ok with someone's life being destroyed based on a 30 year old memory with zero coming from anywhere.How men are being treated in the media, the biased judicial system, hiring quotas etc are all way more important than who you support a female who works in a male dominated industry, quotas can be dangerous and if unqualified people are being hired due to their vaginas, people can and will die.Sorry to rant, but hugs to you all. You aren't in this alone. There are a ton of us women who legitimately see what is happening and we don't like it either. So we are spreading awareness and speaking up any chance we get. Third wave feminism has set women back decades in terms of equal treatment and gives us victim status while demonizing all men as those who have made us such.Sorry ladies. I am not a victim.

I did manage to find a false positive listed as a Russian troll, but to be fair the guy was buying retweets and later deleted his channel and renamed his twitter, so it would have been easy to drop that account through the cracks.The biggest thing that I want to draw attention to is that the researcher has repeatedly expressed disappointment that anyone focusing on ""muh Russian Trolls"" is completely missing the point of the study, which details how the bots are a tiny fraction of a fraction, and that most of them have since been purged by twitter.In reference to he says ""This one gets it right."" an excerpt from that article:>None of that is to say this was Bay's intention. The 38 page research paper explains his methodology in-depth and with great clarity. He draws conclusions based on the dataset he has acquired and even states that it has ""limitations"" and the study is of a nature"". In his conclusion, he remarks that the assertions made within his paper must be considered only within the ""limited scope of the data set"".>He knows that makes for a less exciting story.>""Having worked as a journalist for many years, I know how the game works,"" he explains.>Bay is ""moderately disappointed in some of the major media brands"" that ran articles without taking the time to get a little deeper. He understands that some of his findings were buried because they produce a less enticing lede than ""Russian Troll Army invading the Star Wars galaxy."">That's just not what his research suggests.>""The suspected Russian trolls are so few that it is basically the normal amount of Russian trolls you would expect to be present in a high-profile online debate.""And now for some tweets:>I don't come to that conclusion at all.**Some journalists have wrongly extracted that from the paper**. The paper just shows that there is deliberate politicization happening, i.e. people are inserting partisan politics into Star Wars discussions now for different reasons. true. But having worked as a journalist for many years myself, I know the game. ""Russian trolls invade Star Wars galaxy"" is much more fun than ""Angry alt-righters use Star Wars fan discussion to vent political viewpoints"". Or ""On social meda, people are political"" 😀 That's the real question, isn't it? And **if everyone could stop focusing on the tiny detail about Russian trolls in the paper**, they would find at least a partial answer in it: People fanning the flames for political reasons, even in SW discourse. all due respect to the journalist, the study actually says the opposite. There's only a small number of bots**, but an interesting number of trolls, and a lot of people with a political agenda. Also, I graduated, thanks has nothing to with it. Russian trolls are everywhere, they insert themselves in discussions all over the Internet and have done so for years. Star Wars fandom is just another venue. The paper is on deliberate politicization of fandom in general, not just Russian efforts. the paper. That's not what it says. **Suspected Russian trolls are a tiny group within a larger one**. The Russian troll activities target anything where disruption can be made. But it's just a small part of the findings. this guy is low-key roasting journos and randos that didn't read the paper and are only interested in getting that juicy ""RUSSIA!!1!!"" clickbait, which, ironically is another component of how insanely political literally everything on twitter is these days (i.e. the thing he was ACTUALLY studying)As a final note, he's also perfectly willing to talk to people who have criticisms of the work, even tiny YouTube Channels:",1

"I disagree with a fundamental premise of this article. The author seems to be under the impression that because gaming journalism is inherently shallow, it attracts people who are essentially well-meaning schlubs with no talent. He doesn't stop to consider that the quality may be shit because it's filled with people who are *malicious*; people who aren't just doing this because they like talking about stuff, but people who fucking hate the thing they cover and want to destroy it.And I'm not sure why he thinks this. Is it because gaming publications are inherently aimed at hobbyists and would thus preclude any advancement into serious fields? If so, he should stop to consider that it isn't 2005; video games are not some thing you do in a basement somewhere. They're a multi-billion dollar industry and so the defense a small hobby has against social climbers is virtually gone. And that's not mentioning how becoming popular within a niche is a well known tactic; it's how the Paul brothers got rich, and Cardi B, and virtually every ""sensation"" since Justin Bieber. Why wouldn't opportunists be lurking around? Why *wouldn't* an industry bigger than movies have people willing to tank their own reputations to destroy it?More to the point, it *is* possible to produce quality content we could describe as ""gaming journalism"". Yeah, rehashing press releases is stupid and but there are people who conduct interviews with developers, mess around with hardware, report on the society and culture surrounding games, (in ways that aren't just polemics against consumers) conduct serious reviews of titles, etc, etc.So I don't think ""game journalism sucks because it's just not possible for it not to suck"" is at all a valid stance to take; it's lazy and ignores the fact that gaming publications hire people who fucking hate video games. This naive view of games journalism still being issues of *Nintendo Power* and shit like is just flat-out wrong.

"Despite having a trans girlfriend, I’ve been lurking meta since I discovered it this spring. I generally agree with most of the viewpoints of the posters here, from gun control, the insanity of the left, the anti illegal immigration sentiments, JT, Pro Bernier, affirmative action, etc. Even on a lot of the trans issues; regardless of how I feel about my gf, i totally get how it’s weird to most people, and I frankly have no issue if you want to call her a man. I mean, it’s an asshole move and lacks grace if you do it to a person’s face, but I won’t hate you for it, I get it (I’m a huge Shapiro fan, and he does not mince words on the subject). Im Pro Jordan Peterson (as is my trans gf)But I will guess that most of the “hate” towards trans people on meta is coming from people who have never actually met or had a with a trans person. Like any segment, there are crazies, and likely a higher percentage than in gen pop, sure. But calling trans people mentally retarded and saying they can’t do a job that has nothing to do with their gender really is pure hate. I would never say you folks don’t have the right to say it, I’m a free speech absolutist, but you do nothing but hurt your side of the political spectrum. Yes, the left is filled with hate at the moment, but you are just continuing the cycle and turning away folks like me who are on board with most things that the PPC party champions. It’s fine to have your opinion, but to have that much hate for people (CANADIANS) you have never met is telling more of you than of them. Not all trans folks are activists trying to change our society, most I have met are actually the opposite; opposed to the activism, they don’t want that spotlight, they just want to lead normal lives. There currently isn’t any that helps trans people as much as actually does, until that time this is in a lot of cases the best course of action for a happier life.I would also like to note, that not all trans people are actually legit gender dysmorphic, I have met a few that are straight up flaming gay dudes that took it too far. You know what that means, being able to tread that line?It’s called nuance, something sorely lacking on both sides. I hate the crazy left, but the vitriol from some here is just as bad.

Historically, the DA wants convictions and will condone arresting men on the flimsiest of evidence. The DA pointing out that there is no evidence might be the only damning proof Mr. Goldman needs. Edit: holy shit, the article gets better and better. The school had no basis for expelling him and wouldn't explain their position; the assistant DA confirmed the DA's recommendation; and **Goldman was never even charged.** Reddington is a borderline **psychopath**.Edit: thank you /u/MalyceAforethought , psychopath vs sociopath is an important distinction.Edit: moving this here for visibility.For anyone not familiar personality disorders it may seem like a nebulous and interchangeable distinction. 'Psychopath' sounds scarier but they're typically less violent, more calculating and more manipulative; they don't experience empathy or guilt. Etiology leans toward congenital.

(funnily enough you are literally arguing for a system like horse you are a retard7:20 You argue dead cells as if the company isn't founded on capitalism, the reason it can work as an ""idea sharing"" is because it has 11 people in it, telltale had 275 employees and you want them to all go their own direction? you also ignore companies like tale of tales that couldn't even function with 3 people, you jump from comparing large scale productions to a team of 10, saying the failings are purely because those 300 people didn't have that same idea structure while ignoring the 100 or so other factors that lead to success or downfall7:45 Steam =/= The companies on its platform, you instantly group everything on steam as capitalist when you don't know the composition of any of the studios on there, you cant sit there and argue Dead cells is a working example or Marxism but look at all this shit on steam its Capitalist scum conveniently ignoring Dead cells is on steam that is some amazing cognitive dissonance, since for all you know the Day Z guys could have been using the same team setup and Dead Cells8:29 Gamergate wasn't about Anita, at least get one fact straight in the entire video9:08 ""So one company made once concession"" This is literally the argument you are making to support marxism, that this one company succeeding using a system you like is what should tip the scales against all the other failures using that systemNow we end on more strawmen points",1

"In her defense, there was no reason for her to be slammed to the ground face-first. Just like there would be no reason to slam a dude face-first into the ground in the same circumstances. is a video from a different perspective showing the head-first body slam. Warning- there's a LOT of whining. I recommend going to 0:30 to see the slam. Yeah, she had hit the cop and obstructing him. So yeah, she should be arrested. No pass on obstructing and resisting just because you've got a vagina and you managed to not be overweight. Yeah, she was making it hard to put the cuffs on. But cops should be trained to determine how much force it will take to get an objective accomplished, and to then not exceed that. Just because you've got the strength to slam a person's head to the sidewalk does not mean that it is the right thing to deploy when there's not any real danger in the situation (unless she starts clawing at the face). This could happen to your grandpa after he had four too many beers and wouldn't leave at closing time. It's not about gender or pussypasses. It is about having law enforcement that isn't trying to escalate just so they get a chance to relive their high school football or wrestling glory. I've had to fight my (more drunken than I, but not by a lot) brother on a sidewalk in Amsterdam once (note- New Years in Amsterdam is a lot of fun and I highly recommend against it). There are plenty of safe ways to put a person on the ground that don't involve risking damaging their head.American football works by the principle that when you hit an opposing player so hard that he doesn't want to be hit again, he doesn't play as well for a while. We do not need to use this mentality in our policing. We can use it in the courts. But not on the streets. It DOES take more skill on the part of the cops to subdue someone without hurting them. Similarly, it takes more skill to body-slam someone than to just shoot then in the chest 9 times. We don't tolerate cops shooting people who are not an immediate threat. We require them to use something that admittedly exposes them to more risk and requires more skill on their part. Why should other extreme escalations of force (without regard for the subject's safety) be okay? This could be your grandpa.",1

How can you want everyone to be with everyone yet not want to be with Nazis and Russian Bots? Are we going to pretend these people don't exist and walk around with a culture that allows the most heinous of rights violations in the name of multiculturalism, which counters to the greatest document in human history(The Constitution)? But that in itself is constructing a strawman, but I seriously don't understand the left at this point because they are not Liberal. Siding with thugs like Antifa, Trying to destroy a man's life on allegations alone, and pushing critically retarded goonery like harassing conservative figures in public restaurants? [What the hell are they I thought Hillary Clinton was too deep, but fuck man. The NPC meme, while being a strawman and rather lame meme, fits so well.

"You know what annoys me about this. It's not the weird ""not oppressed enough"" vibe, it's that their argument doesn't actually make sense.So they start with a number of LGBT individuals saying how they're ""just like you"". They also have a bunch of other unrelated traits that SJWs don't like, just to make sure that you know to hate them.Then they present a bunch of supposed to the idea that pushing ""we're just like you"" is bad, but their are A woman complaining that she accused of having kids for welfare. I assume because she's black. I was under the impression that the 'B' in LGBT stood for 'bisexual', not 'black', shows what I know!2. A woman complaining about being harassed and arrested on the suspicion of being a sex worker. It's not clear why from the avatar though, but I'm guessing she's supposed to be South-East Asian? Either way, I'm not sure what the point is. Racism is bad, but what does that have to do with LGBT people?3. Homeless woman(?) complains that their sexuality bars them from shelters. Giving them the benefit of the doubt that this is a real problem, it is actually relevant. What I'm failing to see is how that demonstrates a problem with ""just like you"" messaging. Surely if the people running these shelters understood that being gay wasn't really a big deal, they'd let this person in. Also this homeless woman has autism, that isn't actually relevant, but they pretend it is.4. Immigrant from ???, at least that's what I assume. Ignoring the weird ""gender variant culture"" stuff, I'm not really sure what the issue is here, again. Colonialism was bad. Racism against immigrants is also bad. How is this an LGBT issue?5. Victim of the War on Drugs. I'm guessing orphaned after the Houston Heroin Bombings of 2004. Seriously though, the war of drugs is bad and has had a lot of collateral damage. Again, how is this an LGBT issue?6. Wheelchair user complaining about the world being inaccessible to them. Fair enough, I guess. I'm not physically disabled, so I don't know how bad it is for them, but it doesn't matter because it's *not an LGBT issue*.So 6 examples and only one is clearly relevant (and even then includes some irrelevant stuff). None actually demonstrate the problem with ""we're just like you"" messaging though.

It would be foolish to explain that away as mere coincidence. Whether the creators did it or not, their worlds are loaded with the idea at the core of that having dark skin is Firstly there were many settings about those other human sub cultures, where you played AS members of those ethnic groups, from Al-Qadim to Maztica.As for the idea that Orc bad because skin green, that's bullshit. There are any number of races with green skin & even darker shades of skin that were not evil, from Dryads, to some species of elves.As for Dark Elves, well they've been depicted with skin running from slate grey to light mauve, to dark purple & yes even obsidian black.",1
"In the state of California an engagement ring is a promise! Not an gift. By law it has to be given back unless its after marriage. What a fucking entitled slut cunt!""In California we turn to a law dating back to 1939 which specifically addresses engagement rings and other gifts in of Code section 1590; it states: Where either party to a contemplated marriage in this State makes a gift of money or property to the other on the basis or assumption that the marriage will take place, in the event that the donee refuses to enter into the marriage as contemplated or that it is given up by mutual consent, the donor may recover such gift or such part of its value as may, under all of the of the case, be found by a court or jury to be just. In this case the ""donor"" is the person (i.e., the man) giving the engagement ring, and the ""donee"" is the person (i.e., the woman) receiving it. A gift in of marriage can be revoked, unlike other gifts. Thus, California law is very clear on what happens to the ring - if the woman calls off the wedding, it goes back to the man. Also, if both parties agree that the wedding is off then the man gets the ring back. This California law has wide ranging impact for property given in of marriage. In an important case on the subject - Shaw v. Shaw (1964) 227 Cal.App.2d 159, a man and woman lived together for four years. He placed her name on real property because he relied on her promise that she would marry him when her divorce was final. The couple separated before marrying and the woman eventually married another. The court awarded all property back to the man because she failed to marry him. This has an impact on our society today because of the number of couples living together before marriage.""",1

"I think one of the big things is that feminist types want to see only fantasy that makes them feel good about themselves, while me (and I assume a bunch of others) want to experience stories. Flawed characters who hit close to home may not always make you feel good about yourself, but they make you think, they give you more than just the creator trying to flatter the idealised self you imagined for yourself. Now many of these people say things like ""so you can believe dragons and not muh but they don't understand that it's different. We need to connect to the characters and honestly, a lot of the time people connect to others because they understand their pain. My example is Harry Dresden, because I am a huge fan and know my shit. So. Many feminists hate his character. But here is the thing, I connect t him because I am similar. Sure, he is a man, a wizard and detective, I'm a woman, trainee at a dental lab and generally a pussy when it comes to physical danger. But he makes fun of himself, like me, he has this huge sense of justice, like me, he gets in trouble because he can not just bend the knee and spit on his morals, like me. The pitfalls of this character are similar to my own problems, just amped up and with magic. I could get him. I do not say you all need to be like him or me. But I can feel a sort of fictional Not trying to make it sound like I am some brilliant person, I am not. But when I participate in the stories of Harry Dresden I have to look at myself from an outside perspective and I have to acknowledge our shared flaws. It takes some which a lot of the more SJW-inclined people don't do, because it makes them So lets just take some women's march gender studies girl, with pink hair, who is vegan and freaks out a lot about random first world things.

Meaning you have to keep drilling expensive shale oil wells for very short-term gains, and shale oil's the only reason the US suddenly became a net exporter in the last decade or Saudis know this and American shale oil is the reason they first tried to drive the price up (to punish the US, as it was still a net importer) and then crater the price (to punish them for exporting). The result is that any upward movement in price benefited American companies more than the Saudis, and any threat to cut production meant that American shale oil could fill the gap at a very nice price. The side effects of this was the obliteration of Venezuela's oil-based economy and a serious fuck you to Russia's petro industry. &#x200B;The shale oil crash is gonna make parts of the Dakotas look like Alberta after Trudeau sr. was done with us, and if we could get a fucking pipeline built with all these damned envirotards running around we'd be a great position to satisfy American demand instead of having them buy Saudi oil and thus fund further global terrorism.

"From 4chan:* it's a perfect storm.1. The left is reeling. The left in America has a near religious worldview. Everyone agrees with them. They're so, soooo smart. The smartest ever. They're the party of good ideas and civil rights and that means that they have a monopoly on those issues. And that means that everyone not them is the exact opposite -- Stoooooopid rednecks who hate everyone and will never amount to anything. The US is fundamentally liberal and thanks to Obama, we've entered a liberal golden age and the GOP will have to spend the next 30 years out in the wilderness until they learn how to be DNC-lite.... Wait, what do you mean she lost? Wait, it's Trump? And he's doing a good job? *And half the country agrees with him?* That doesn't make any sense! There MUST be something wrong with the country and reality itself, because lefties *can't be wrong.* 2. At the same time you have them having this mental breakdown due to the world refusing to confirm to their fantasies... You have their reaction being organized protest. Heavily organized protest, to the point of being basically glorified mob actions. And the way the left does this stuff is they synchronize the protests. Very effective... but it makes it hard to ignore the fact that you're all synchronizing things. Remember when we called them Snowflakes and they got pissed? It touches on an unspoken assumption. The lefties might all have the same beliefs and might all say the same things and might all be wearing the same pussy hats and might all be carrying the same professionally printed signs, but *they are all unique individuals* who happened to come upon these exact same ideas/phrases/talking points/etc because **they're just that smart.** The NPC meme points out that, well, they're not getting all those ideas from their own galaxy sized brains. They're getting them from, well, indirectly from Soros mostly, but from alpha lefties who hand them out. The Rachel Maddows and the ShareBlues and the Media Matters of the world. And on some level... they know this. And it makes them feel really, REALLY uneasy. 3. Finally, you have the fact that the NPC meme is people mocking the left. *Mocking.* **The left.** The left, which is comprised of the best of humanity. The left, who are smarter than everyone else. The left, who have the most perfect golden morality and ethics and beliefs. ***How DARE you!?*** And yet... everyone is.So, a perfect storm - poking several deep seated insecurites the left has, all while laughing at those insecurities and their reaction to it all.

As a self-conscious teenager, if the game-making excitement had been nurtured a bit earlier I think I would have started making games sooner. You need some kind of aspirational figure, or someone who's excited about the prospect of it - or at least, that's what I needed and I didn't have it.

Reading through this it seems like this person is needlessly gendering the first issue they bring up, in reality I don't think that there are any significant paragon developer figures we can all look up to. More than that, if you're citing a group of career advisors who likely have no experience with gaming but watch TV and movies like it's a religion, no wonder they aren't advising that you go into games.

Her later quotes argue for greater but do so in a relatively sane way, so it could be.The article goes into her game a bit. It is evidently ten minutes long, but is a to the games Ico and Inside, the film Paths of Glory, and the German TV show Generation of War? How do you manage that many in a ten minute game?Some literal unconscious character is central to a concept Fernandez was interested in: creating an emotional attachment between the player and the 'tool' used to solve puzzles (in this case, a human body).She shows some remarkable sanity regarding how she thinks greater representation should be achieved:>""One thing that I really want to stress is that I don't think the solution is to police or censor violent or sexual depictions of women in games. To me, it's about creating a bigger variety of female instead of just repeatedly falling back on character tropes. It's in everyone's best interest. We'll have far more interesting games as a result.Again, a generous interpretation would be that she wants to make her own games with new female characters, our over at will appreciate that approach I think.Then some of the facts regarding the Battlefield V fiasco, and this gem:>""It's intimidating,"" she admits, ""but it's more important to me to make stories I'm interested in with characters I'm interested in, rather than fear this imaginary audience who will probably troll me online at some point in my career anyway.The author of the article is kinda bad, but the dev depicted seems to have her head/PR game on straight.",1

In the years past I have been hailed as a champion - for 7 straight years I have spent November as a chastitised christian. I hoped to continue this legacy. And last night, I failed.One as regal as I, failing? Impossible. Only the gods could achieve such power to stop me. I guess that night I was dealing with a god.I'm on the YouTube homepage, trying to find some epic Morgz videos, when I stumble upon a certain video. This damn video. Its bright thumbnail, its captivating title - it utterly fascinated me. This cursed video: it was none other than “Fortnite's most EPIC event EVER!”, posted by the one and only Ali A.My body immediately began to shake, and my penis shot straight up. The most EPIC event EVER? What could it be? I felt a pull towards the video like I had never felt before. It took me awhile to realize the effect the video was having on me. I fell back in my chair in fear. In agony. In complete and utter despair.My hand grabbed the mouse and began to slowly slide over to the thumbnail. I kicked and screamed and cried, trying and failing to stop my body. Sweat was dripping down my entire body. Minutes later, the pointer had finally reached its And with a cry, the hand that didn't feel like mine anymore clicked.I was immediately met with a scream. “THIS IS IT LADIES AND GENTLEMEN!” Purple light streamed from the computer monitor and began to fill the room. The voice on the screen continued talking, seemingly in an ancient tongue. My entire body began to quiver as something awakened inside of me. My speakers began to shake as something inside of them grew louder. Was this music? Or was this something else?The music finally picked up, and as Ali's intro began, I came harder and faster than I ever had before. The sensation rendered me The last thing I remember seeing that night was my cum streaked over his face. And it looked like he was smiling.I woke up to a rising sun. My clothes were back on, my sweat was wiped away, and my penis was flaccid. I could finally see again. Was this all a dream? No, there’s no way. It felt too real.My suspicions were immediately crushed as I looked to the monitor. In a drunk stupor, it looks like I had changed my desktop background to a picture of him. He was staring into my heart - into my soul. And he was covered in my cum.So, guys, whatever you do, don’t watch Ali A's newest video. Anybody less powerful than I would surely be dead.

"tl;dr is last paragraph.It looks like you're going to work on the ""east side"" which is the area. If it's a tech job, understand now that tech workplaces are pretty bad in most places when it comes to the social justice set.I lived in Seattle and outlying areas for a really longtime. The city has drastically changed for the worse. It's not yet San Francisco bad, but they're trying. city government is more corporate oriented, so you'll still see pro-business Republicans in municipal government. They tow the party line on most social issues but it isn't a of that said, Western Washington is a really diverse place. Want to live in the woods with rednecks? You can do that. Want to live in a trendy condo? No problem. Want a suburb? Plenty to choose from, and it's all commutable to the east side. For the most part, you can live in the sort of place that suits you and the amenities in the urban core are superb. State government isn't great but not nearly as bad as things you need to know about:1.) The rain is oversold but there is a marine layer over Western Washington for about 7 to 8 months out of the year. It's really, really grey.2.) The cost of living is terrible, Traffic is a nightmare along the I-5 and the I-405. Seattle is willfully shrinking traffic capacity and the east side simply can't build enough. Topography aggravates this. Avoid bridges.4.) Politics have radicalized over the past 20 years as Californians and people from the East Coast have flooded into the city for tech jobs.5.) Yet large corporations like Boeing, Starbucks, Microsoft, and especially Amazon dominate the political and economic landscape. It's really the worst of both worlds.Good things:1.) The economy is great.2.) World class food, festivals, beer.3.) Water, mountains, forests, all within an hour drive. It's an outdoors man's paradise.4.) Once you get away from Seattle most people are really chill. Sometimes too chill. 5.) Sea-Tac is a real international airport.6.) Great sports is an 8 on the California scale. The east side is a 5. Most of the rest of Western Washington is a 3 or 4. If you can afford the cost of living and are capable of biting your tongue now and then, I'd say don't hesitate to give it a go if you have a real opportunity up there.",1

"Someone debunked this guy - and it was Cecilia? What timeline is this?> Picciolini, who describes himself as a “former white supremacist leader,” came onto Kotaku’s radar in July, when he hosted a Reddit AMA. In it, he claimed that right-wing extremists go into multiplayer games to recruit vulnerable demographics into their cause. Intrigued, my colleague Kashmir Hill and I reached out to Picciolini to hear more. We were curious about the right-wing movers and shakers who could fit an entire political pitch into a Fortnite match.> When we asked Picciolini for evidence of his claim and an interview, he referred us to “the many who have experienced the recruitment” and attached a few screenshots of Nazi imagery in open world games like All Points Bulletin. He also forwarded a screenshot of the game Active Shooter, a school shooting simulator, which was pulled from Steam before its release. Another screenshot was from a YouTube video titled “Fag Jews” in which someone named AuTiSmGaMiNg played Call of Duty. It had 11 views.> It’s hard to imagine that the blustering Picciolini has seen enough to make up for the NPR author’s otherwise sparse evidence, and if you have spent any time in an online multiplayer game, you know that some player-made digital swastika is as likely a product of some 12-year-old edgelords as it is of neo-Nazi propagandists seeking to turn the teens to their side. This leads to basic questions: Were any victims of the alleged conversion tactics interviewed? Any recruiters? If this is happening on a large scale, why haven’t any games especially ones who spend countless hours each week playing online games—caught a whiff of this wild thing and reported on it?> NPR’s sources, at least as laid out in their report, simply do not provide adequate support for the claim that white supremacists are actively recruiting gamers on multiplayer games on a scale broad enough for anyone to be concerned about it. And to take it a step further, mainstream media publications claiming a clear pipeline between gamers and far-right extremists are buckling into a trope in normie games coverage that simply needs to end if anyone is going to responsibly cover the increasingly established gaming community: parental as journalism. It’s what turned the mainstream conversation around video game addiction into a hot-take circus of bad research and even worse interviewing tactics. It’s what’s completely distorted the scientific methods toward understanding whether violent games make kids more violent. And it’s the sort of thing that, in the ‘80s, led suburban parents to question whether their Dungeons & teens were literal Satanists.> The NPR story’s author, who is a mother of two, wrote a book this year titled The Art of Screen Time: How Your Family Can Balance Digital Media and Real Life. Reached out to for comment, she did not respond. When I asked Picciolini why he feels confident stating that there is a pipeline between gamers and far-right extremists, he said this:>> “I receive emails or calls weekly from parents concerned that their young sons are beginning to use language aligned with alt-right and white nationalist ideologies, narratives denying the Holocaust or defaming Jews, discussing conspiracy theories related to George Soros.

I'm 55 and have dealt with a LOT of people in my life who *could* have done such a thing. What I'm saying is very few people DID it. (The fact that those people were women in my case is only pertinent in this sense: I'm sure that that being a low-life cunt who try to steals credit is equally prevalent amongst women and men.)Now according to the 'article' this is because I'm a man, and that it happens to women a lot more. I submit that it was because when someone did it to me I read them the riot act and stood up for myself. Which is something that women should be able to do given that they have had the freedom to be 'strong independent women' for at least the last 40 years.So it seems to me that this article is saying that women are weak and unwilling to defend themselves.",1

This goes triple for anyone putting out aggressively critical declarations meant to control other people via junk science and masked hatred (you know, telling us to put aside all of our concerns about the biased and hostile press, academics, and leftists who are openly attacking us and our hobby - while they colonize our communities and industry - because some of them are receiving blowback from their targets? And given sjws are targeting millions of people, is it a surprise that some of that blowback is more severe?Keep in mind, gamergate hasn't actually harmed anyone. 99% of the harassment is just criticism, albeit frequently laced with naughty words. Maybe, just maybe, these crybabies are trying to conflate a few random line-crossers with all of their opponents because doing so is a convenient deflection - a great substitute for actual arguments and data supporting their bullshit ideas?The sjw cries out in pain as xir strikes you..If your declaration is that none of us are allowed to tear apart Anita's retarded ideas or criticize Zoe's cluster B lunacy until that magical day when ""everyone"" (aka literally all of us) is finally nice to ""everyone"" (aka literally all of you), then I'm happy to tell you to go fuck yourself.

"I chose the gender option on my PGCE course as I'm a computer science teacher it seemed like an important topic with all that goes on in computing industry and there is a significant gender difference at the GCSE level (girls make up around 20% of the cohort). One of the things i found hardest about this topic was finding any fucking evidence to support any of the claims that were being banded around. So many of the papers i read seemed to consist of them waffling on a lot, citing each other, and not actually producing any sort of data. Some of the data was blatently cherry picked, some didn't even support the claims that the paper was claiming they found the whole thing a complete waste of my life, i scraped a pass. The thing that pissed me off the most though was talking to one of the others on the course who bashed out his assignment over a weekend, found some vague sources which supported what he was saying for references and got just short of the top mark bracket for it. I'd spent the best part of 6 weeks of my life when i wasn't on placement, reading papers and writing my own. a lot of them are still on my kindle from where i sent copies to it to read on the commute. In case anyone is curious, my conclusion is that the industry having a slightly higher ratio of females in tech jobs, than the ratio of university graduates, which in turn is slightly higher then the ratio of university applicants, which is compariable to girls taking the lower education levels indicates that there is no on the basis of gender, at least not at the industry level (individual companies may do, but its not a general trend) and if anything the numbers more indicate the industry making efforts to recruit and retain talented women where it could find them. This was supported by anecdotal evidence from recruitment companies who basically said skill women who could prove it could dictate their salaries and by the study which showed women have a 2 to 1 hiring advantage in stem subjects. I found a single study indicating that at the primary school level, girls and boys have a similar level of interest in technology (i think it was Finnish, which was apparent a mark against me, despite the fact i couldn't find any uk ones). Which by the time they are 14 has deminished to the point where they don't choose computing as an option. Despite the investment of huge amounts of resources, there has been no noticable change to girls taking up the subject. I was unable to find any data indicating at what point they lose it or why girls lose interest in technology, but felt that more research needs to be done on the 11 to 14 year old age bracket to investigate this trend.",1

"Uh... Hunting in this game? I find tracking thr legendary animals much more fun because there's no way to fuck up the pelt quality. You can just dumb as many shotgun shells as you like in the cunt and the pelt will be just top tits. Standard hunting? You gotta find the animal. Then study it. If it's skinny or sick or too young, no matter how well you do it'll give you a shitty pelt so don't bother, find another that's healthy and old enough. Then you've gotta shoot it, once, with the right arrow, and make sure the first shot is either an instant kill of a kill, because if you shoot it so it won't die straight away you'll fuck up the quality of the pelt or worse, it'll run so far before it dies you'll lose it in the chase. Then you'll get a perfect pelt.Then you got to finish hunting, and get to town quick enough that rot doesn't set in t the carcass (because selling the carcass is what you really want, fuck donating to the camp, I'll just pay for camp upgrades out of my own pocket. The camp upgrades are useful don't get me wrong, I'd say donate until you have the right value to upgrade Dutch's tent, then only donate the bare minimum to the NPCs don't bother you. Only donate pelts you need for crafting.) if you don't sell it quick enough it'll rot and the value will be harmed. Fuck it, do the fake fisherman trick. To get provisions in your camp just buy the meat from a fucking butcher. Now I know that sounds like fun to some people, and there's days I'm in the mood for that shit, too. But if it doesn't sound like your kind of thing? You can ignore the hunting mostly. Just shoot birds out of the air every now and then so you can make arrows, because that's kind of your only silent weapon you can carry a lot of ammo for. At least as early in the game and I am. Fishing on the other hand? **Fuck me** this game had good fishing. And just like hunting legendary animals, there's legendary fish to catch. The first chapter *is* boring as fuck. As soon as the game tells you it's Chapter 2, the instant you park wagon in the second camp, the game finally opens up and becomes a good game. That's about an hour or 2 in.",1

They know it doesn't really matter how much harder they work, the wealth they create won't be shared with them, neither by wages, nor by taxes into society as a whole. It just will become then nth house or car or yacht or wife or mistress of the also know, no matter how much of their time an effort and health they sacrifice for the company, they are out the door, the moment they are not needed they know all this by first hand They know no other reality.",1

Since it’s quite clear the student population aren’t happy with her being the SU President, since although from the outside it seems menial, she and the student union do impact student life massively. She’s been suspended from the position and the mural door is locked only temporarily, since it is of great value to the university and they don’t want it defaced simply to catch those responsible, as I’ve seen a number of people on here suggest.

You can add console gamers too with D3.If you seriously don’t understand why telling this to your most hardcore fans who have waited over 5 years for any news regarding a Diablo project isn’t retarded then you are. Add to that the fact these guys fucking paid hundreds for a ticket and thousands to travel and stay there only to get a slap on the face. Not to mention the fucking video they released hyping this turd up saying it was a good time to be a diablo fan just to sell more con tickets.A mobile game is not what any established Diablo fan wants for several reasons. I won’t go into detail because they should be fucking obvious if you used your brain but here’s a small list: predatory monetization and mtx, game limited by hardware capacity of phones, gameplay simplified to work with a touchscreen for a controller, etc. Oh and the fucking company they partnered with that developed the abomination has a horrible history of p2w games.People aren’t fucking entitled, they’re rightfully pissed at how something they love is being dragged through the mud and how the head of marketing at Blizzard appears to be a dropped on the head as a baby orangutan.

"I imagine that there's a lot more prejudice in states, or at least communities, where there's a ""black culture"" well divided from the ""white culture"" of the state's majority, specially if ""both sides"" of the culture divide have enough numbers to be noticeable. Prejudice and bigotry don't get spontaneously generated in an instant, it's culturally built and reinforced by negative interactions with the side they are prejudiced against. Someone who never gets in contact with ""the other"" might end a bit prejudiced, but unless their culture really build said group as boogeymen, those prejudices and stereotypes likely won't last long after actual contact with people from that subgroup (that don't follow the prejudiced stereotype, of course). Might even be only at an individual level at first (""one of the good ones"", so to speak), but even that already starts breaking down the it's the places where there's an ""active conflict"" between the groups where the bigotry truly festers. It's where there's a defined ""black community"" that hates ""them whiteys"", and a ""white community"" that hate ""them niggers"" that bigotry truly gets to live. Humans are not really good at (perceived) unrequited hate. You need to make ""the other"" a villain for outright hatred to really take root.",1

"Gaming/Nerd Culture, +2Plus either Official Socjus or Socjus Attack By Media for the +1The article literally argues that *Lovecraft contributed nothing to horror besides themes rooted in racism, misogyny and homophobia*. This is going far beyond merely saying he had unsavory opinions. The argument is that *every single Lovecraftian trope is unavoidably tainted and carries within it Lovecraft's own Everything good about Lovecraft, the article argues, is evident in the works of previous authors.The implication is inherently censorious. Not only is Lovecraft to be removed from the canon, but *nothing that feels too Lovecraftian* (in aesthetics or tone) can be permitted.Not only that, Lovecraft is attacked for ""grossly simplifying"" ""mental illness"" but that just shows absolute stupidity about Lovecraft's depiction. Lovecraft wasn't depicting mental illness or ""actual"" insanity. Legally speaking, insanity is a complete break from reality, but in Lovecraft-land *people in mental asylums are closer to reality than the rest of us*. This is an atrocious demand. The analogue would be that, because Tolkein had some unsavory opinions that influenced his writing, the entire genre of fantasy must abolish the use of orcs, elves, dwarves, etc. They're going far beyond merely ""critically discussing"" the work of previous authors. This is a demand for a purge of the canon and even the *destruction of a particular style of writing*.",1

"> I've read people insisting the Asians vs Harvard case isn't about Affirmative Action. Is that true?Not directly. Indirectly, the reason Asians suffer is because of affirmative action. you could ensure that only white people would suffer from affirmative action, but that would lead to such a decrease in the number of white people that people's eyebrows might start to go up. You can rest assured that the SJWs don't want their own children to have a close to zero chance of getting into top schools. So in practice, if Harvard loses, it's the end for affirmative action - at least in its current form. I am fairly optimistic now that King Kavanaugh is on the court.> In any case, if Affirmative Action is upheld, what about reverse Affirmative Action? Could employers look negatively on applicants who might have benefited from AA?Legally, no. In practice, they may try. This just ends up harming minorities who actually do have merit.

"In regards to games When Dragon Age 2 came out I was pumped. I looked at the BioWare devs acting like fucking clowns and brushed it off. (Although, ""When you press a button, something something awesome has to happen. Button. Awesome. Connect."" is permanently burned into the part of my brain that responds to cringe.) Still pumped. Then I played it. I remember the exact moment I raised an eyebrow. It was in Kirkwalls lowdown at night, and I'd just dispatched a group of enemies. Then another one appeared out of nowhere. Then I turned the corner and the exact same thing happened. These combat encounters littered the game. And it's not the good kind of combat encounter that's fun. It's the bad kind that's only there to make it difficult to walk from point A to point B and pad out the length of the game. And speaking of padding out the length, there were so many fucking reused levels. It's really not funny. Like, no other game I can think of has such poor variety in levels. But fuck it, I'll enjoy the story....Oh wait, **there isn't one.**And I don't mean ""The story is bad."" I mean it doesn't fucking exist. It's just a series of disjointed events that somehow explode into a war and also that trinket you found in the deep roads was super important. Aren't you glad we told you nothing about it? But... Well the original dragon age had a kind of disjointed story too, I suppose. I guess I'll enjoy the characters. Let's see... You don't get points for keeping combining the best parts of Awakening. Because we've already played awakening. Fenris is... No. Isabella is... I gave her to the Arishok on every playthrough because if she's gonna cause a bunch of Chad's to invade a city because someone stole their nerd book she really is too dumb to gave meaning to the phrase ""Burn it before it lays eggs."" In my mind. So no, Dragon Age 2 was BioWares worst showing to date in my mind. So I decided to check the the reviews were glowing. All of them.And I sat and thought about this for a while, how can something that came from a formula they'd knocked out of the park on the first try, then fucked it up so hard, be so well liked?Then I saw all the ads running on the pages for the reviews. They were Dragon Age 2 ads. Then I realised. ""Oh, these are bought and paid taken their opinions seriously since. That makes it what, 7 or 8 years almost?",1

Then come in SJWs and i started to get absolutelly sick of losing hours giving honest and detailed answers, full of links, data, arguments, etc, only to receive a line with some accusation of sexism, racism, nazi, or a ""too long didn't read"" answer. In the end i got so sick it turned me the other way arround and now i practically never engage on an honest discussion on the internet; i just shitpost.

Clearly money isn't being socked away in someone's offshore bank it has taken too long has more merit. But after the unexpectedly wildly successful kickstarter, the project manager asked the backers if they should similarly wildly expand the scope of the project... and most were in favor of it. So all that money went into a much bigger game than was originally their methods of raising funds have also been criticized. And for me, this is the seediest part of the game. Offering a land claim token which will eventually allow them to choose land in the universe to gain legal (though imperfect) NPC protection for is silly. On the other hand, the process has been very open and clear to all from the start, so anyone who does contribute funds should know what they are (and aren't) getting.I paid for a game package because I liked what I was seeing, and I'm still pretty happy with it.

"The well deserved hate for this sort of Tumblr style reporting on the BBC aside for a playing a game... on the internet... something MP or MMO which requires interacting with other people.For somebody to even figure out what gender you are let alone your race, you at least need to use some sort of voice voice communication might out you as a woman, depending on your accent/origin it's not inconceivable somebody might figure out you're black as well.Those are a whole lot of different things that need to fall into place though for that to be voice coms and nobody knows whether you're a green trans midget or a strong black womyn... and nobody gives a shit kinda one of the three salient points I want to make here...- Nobody gives a shit who/what you are.The second point is that in most competitive MP games people give each other shit.For the most part that means getting in the easy hits.You're a guy: that makes you a fag, gay, dick, asshole, etc...

It didn't appear that anyone in the industries under attack with them or pandered to them, and there was plenty of media that wasn't about them so (unless family was involved) anyone who wanted to ignore them could pretty much do so.In terms of sheer they may have given the SJWs a run for it, with everything being some satanic ploy to claim the earth for the devil.

"Each of the waves of feminism has made them essentially the ""SJW""s of their time, including the suffragettes, who were the precursor to feminism.Also, don't buy into the narrative that ""the previous waves are ok"" - they were all an example of movements with good intentions that had bad results and extremely bad actions. They got some of what they wanted but a lot of shitty things happened to society to get to where they wanted.For example, you can thank the suffragettes for winning the women's vote, but also forgetting to require women to enroll in the selected service *to* vote and get student aid, meanwhile ALL MALES are required to do so. Oh by the way, all rich property owners before the suffragette movement started were allowed to vote, INCLUDING WOMEN. The suffragette movement didn't fight for the rights of lower class or black women to vote either, just those of the bourgeois and upper class - does that fucking sound familiar to you?Also the suffragettes were *very* violent back then. Some of them behaved like the anti-fa of today.(I had to sift through the first page of left wing news sites APOLOGIZING for suffragette terrorism. Bugs the shit out of me that I have to pull up conservatives but hey, I never said I was a left winger, just a CENTER-left channel is a real cool guy, MGTOW but not the ""women should lose the right to vote"" type.Anyway, what's going to annoy me is after Gen-Z grows up with its conservative/libertarian pushback of all this retarded socjus stuff, maybe 20-30 years from now we'll probably deal with another wave of this retardation, and I can't imagine how much more retarded that wave is going to be after this wave.

"1.) I'm happy that Breitbart managed to get and release this document. 2.) The coverage on Breitbart I checked so far (I did not read all their articles, I only looked at a few) has warped and changed meanings in several places. These are close enough that the sources provided seem to substantiate them, yet if you check the whole manual or look at the evidence provided critically you'll see it's either misleading or false in several places:Example 1: Breitbart: Trump, Conspiracy Theorist - [One of the reasons Google identifies for allegedly widespread public disillusionment with internet free speech is that it “breeds conspiracy context: In [The Good this slide is at the end of the section ""What’s the role of the tech firms in all of this?"", with previous slides detailing how tech firms are mismanaging the issues. Under this context the beginning of the slide ""When it comes to users, all of this bad behaviour and mismanagement..."" and then end ""... breeds conspiracy theories"" has a completely different meaning. Not that internet free speech is breeding conspiracy theories (as Breitbart says), but that the mismanagement of the companies (being intransparent about their algorithms and behavior) breeds such conspiracy stories by removing the ability from people to verify or falsify them easily. (I have to leave now, so only one example for now, I'll edit more in later).3.) In regards to the twitter reply by Bokhari you can see similar methods used. What is said is close to the truth in order to possibly mislead when not accurately checking, but false if you actually do check. One simple example here as well directly in the first tweet: >A few self-described ""centrists"" (who unlike Evil Partisans, are unbiased, non-tribal, always correct and never wrong) have decided The Good Censor is fake news. Ironically, they base this claim on a video that spreads horrendous fake news in its first 5 minutes.Besides the ""centrist"" point as /u/psa_sitch pointed out (but which can be forgiven as some self-proclaimed centrists retweeted it), this is also a false statement. None of them claimed ""The Good Censor"" is fake news, they claimed that Breitbarts reporting of the story is false, biased or misleading.",1

Summary: Rekieta Law goes through Lawyer Mark Zaid's extremely long motion to dismiss Richard Meyer's lawsuit against Mark Waid for tortious interference and defamation. Zaid claims Waid is not subject to Texas jurisdiction and does some extreme twisting of logic and words to reach that conclusion.The major hilarious points are1. Waid/Zaid claiming he has no business in Texas but he regularly attends conventions there and even offered to do business with the owner of Antarctic Press in exchange for them not publishing Meyer's comic book.2. Waid/Zaid claim that defamation was never done in Texas yet there is video/articles of Waid repeating his defaming points against Meyer at a convention in Texas.3. Waid/Zaid claim Waid did not initiate contact with Antractic Press. Waid's own Tweets and previous statement contradict this.4. Waid/Zaid claim Waid did not know Antarctic Press was located in Texas. Waid stated he knew the owners when he Tweeted he was calling them and called a Texas phone number.The lengthy livestream where Rekieta Law tears apart the motion and is in full rant mode can be found here:,1

Just because a person doesn't see confidence as humanity's final form doesn't mean that person is some sort of sleazy guy trying to play on girls' insecurities.

It disgusts me."" And I can avoid saying something thats gonna cause kfarms to raise an eyebrow and make a target out of me. (This is ignoring that we find a distinct overlap in things like consensual incestuous behaviour and things like personality disorder, where we find one we often find the other, but whatever right?)Also people just don't work on facts. Why is Trump in office? Well, primarily he's in office because his opponent was Hillary Clinton. (Literally anyone else would have fucked him to death on election day.) But at least 40% of the reason he's in office is the emotions of his bad example. Better one, Why do people shoot people who break into their homes? 90% of people breaking into your house just want your TV. This is not a problem that requires lethal force. So why do home invaders get shot? Because the guy holding the gun is scared of the potential fact that the home invader *doesn't* just want his TV. Even though that's most likely *just* not the case. So yeah, it's great that Destiny can just fling statistics. Even better that he has that kind of brain that can actually recall statistics. I don't think hes ever been caught being wrong about a statistic. But he's arguing from very much the wrong place.

"Freelancer was Chris's baby, his magnum opus, his big dream. It was 18 months late on release and that was only because Microsoft removed Chris from production management and put more effective managers in charge. It released with most of its major promised features either scaled down or stripped entirely, not even having proper 6DoF movement which was already standard for both contemporary free body and flight models. Plus it was so far over budget Chris had to sell his studio to Microsoft where it was stripped of IP and developer assets then is Chris's MO. Wasteful development that breaks its own successes so often that for every five steps forward it takes four steps back. Rather than creating a base mechanical system and then expanding on it, SC now has a hundred modular expansions but the core it in flux and every time it changes all of those modules need reworking. The dev itself is very good at keeping details from the public, but thanks to Star Marine being sent to a third party we know why it died. SIG provided what they claimed was a near final copy of the game engine, some years into development, and the module was built off that.... But of course the core was nowhere near competed so after doing a ton of work getting it sorted Foundry 42 handed back their version and found it was completely incompatible with the game engine SC had moved into by that time. Then, shortly after, SC moved to an entirely different game engine altogether. So the Star Marine module was entirely rebuilt. - for those of you keeping track at home, that means the module was scratch built three times before partial Alpha release, and needs constant work to keep it functional without adding new features or content even now.Chris is currently on a yearly salary of over $900,000, more than even EA's CEO, he has multiple family members on the payroll for a total of over $3 million.... In perspective his families total salary earnings to date are over $20million according to their tax returns. You could develop a solid AAA-level game for that if you start with a functional engine. Is it any wonder people think there's a personal motivation to sell jpegs? That being said, I personally think it's worse than just a simple scam. I think Chris has started to believe his own bullshit, reinforced by the fan base, and doesn't realise he's a great visionary but a shit-tier manager.Now come at me with all your best down votes you StarTards.

"without forcing women to major in STEM you will gonna never get early communism, we had quotas in factories for women, after about 5-8 years it was clear to everyone that the women cannot work as much and as hard as men, an the ""factory 5 year plan"" was in danger...Then they created something called ""TESA"", meaning ""non-working workers"". These ""workers"" were in offices, and usually were part of the ""management"", but in reality it was a shitty bureaucratic system that slowed down the factory...So they employed women in TESA positions, as most factory floor positions were men, in order to ""equalize"" the genders.The results was this: everyone wanted the nice non-working positions, therefore no one wanted the shitty labor intensive workplaces. The factories got so bogged down by the lack of workforce that they started to pay (even in communism... imagine that) far better the manual labors than the university degree TESA workers.Years later, a 8 class low skill manual laborer (male) could afford a car (total decadent luxury) and yearly seaside holidays (another decadent luxury) while a high skilled university degree TESA worker (usually a woman) could barely afford to live....And the irony was that when the system collapsed, the working men, that got the best wages and best stuff (free holidays, free free food) were the ones to revolt and topple the system... not the shitty intellectuals from TESA that were too scared to do shit.So... even if you mandate it, you still gonna get shit back.

"I'll copy/paste my that guy's annoying. From what I've seen, the article on it was accurate. In fact, I read more or less most of the report myself. Now, what's discussed in this video is this article: http://archive.fo/Q82pXWhich I've previously ignored (because I've read the source). At the time the story came out, they put out 4-5 articles (I don't get it either, so don't ask me), and this article has had all of... 371 comments. The article I've read, however, has - up to now - 14,101 comments: http://archive.fo/yovIUAnd it's accurate. As for what the person in video objects to, it's these parts of the article:> Page 14 of the document acknowledges that a few Silicon Valley tech giants now “control the majority of our conversations,” but that these platforms – including Google – must now break their initial promise to users of free speech and content neutrality.And this:> Google, argues the briefing, must move towards the European tradition and create “well-ordered spaces for safety and civility” rather than “unmediated marketplaces of ideas.”Personally, I'd first contact the person that wrote it. But, that's just me. Since the same person wrote several other articles as well. In the other article - the one which I read - it notes it accurately:> The briefing argues that Google, Facebook, YouTube and Twitter are caught between two incompatible positions, the “unmediated marketplace of ideas” vs. “well-ordered spaces for safety and civility.”> The first approach is described as a product of the “American tradition” which “prioritizes free speech for democracy, not civility.” The second is described as a product of the “European tradition,” which “favors dignity over liberty and civility over freedom.” The briefing claims that all tech platforms are now moving toward the European tradition.""Claims x is the case,"" obviously isn't the same as ""argues x should happen.""And:> The briefing associates Google’s new role as the guarantor of “civility” with the categories of “editor” and “publisher.”The only line I'm not sure would be this:> For example, the briefing argues that tech companies will have to censor their platforms if they want to “expand globally.”It does mention it once or twice, but I'm not sure I'd say ""argues."" For example:> “US-based IT monopolies are already tempted to compromise themselves in order to gain entrance to these vast and fast growing markets. The dictatorial leaders in these countries may be only too happy to collaborate with them since they want to improve their methods of control over their own populations and expand their power and influence in the United States and the rest of the world.”Another thing he objects to is ""Google admits."" I can see how it might be misleading, however I'd say it depends on whether or not the ""Insights Lab"" is from outside Google, which as another user notes it doesn't seem to be the case. If it is, then yeah, it's misleading. If not - and it might not be, because as the other user says there's the link that goes back to Google, and they do say it's ""internal research,"" then it's not necessarily misleading. Here's what Breitbart said on it in a recent article:> Perhaps they buy Google’s explanation that the presentation was just “research” and doesn’t reflect “official Google positions” — a confusing explanation, as the research is about official Google positions. Is Google disagreeing with its own researchers’ assessment of where the company is headed?I'd have still suggested contacting the author of the article first, but eh.Also this:",1

"This seems to a bit of an idiotic topic but there is some merit it in perhaps... though I have seen anime that does the opposite. I'm not talking about like pointless abuse. Honestly in a lot of anime, they abuse the concept of smacking a guy around because he is a dense fucker and can't knock before entering a annoys me a bit too but it isn't a monolith. Take Maken-Ki ecchi as fuck anime. That happens to the main dude, he literally forgets because he rooms with a few chicks. Now it's possible to forget, but in a small defense of them. If you forget 24/7 that's being fucking Secondly this guy does peep on chicks sometimes, so it's hard for him to claim innocence because sometimes he really *isn't* innocent.As much as I found inuyasha to be garbage for this, and other reasons, it made a lot more sense in Ranma 1/2. Ranma *went out of his way* to poke at his, somewhat Sure people should get over their but when someone has about not being feminine enough maybe when you have to live with them you shouldn't tell them like 8 times a day they suck at being a chick. Ranma was a dick to both Akane and other people at least half the time.Now, on the flip side you have recent shows like konosuba and Aho Girl.Kazuma right out states he's having none of this bullshit. he will also smack a bitch if he thinks she's being an idiot, not that ti works with darkness cause she's a kinky masochist and gets turned on by that, even when he acts disgusted at her behavior in public and means it. He will routinely tell aqua she is useless and a bitch in public- because she is.In Aho girl main dude is possibly a bit of a dick but he has lived around the main sex obsessed bitch for his entire life, her precocious ass would routinely do things to him in their childhood that he didn't want to do that might well border on sexual assault, he was too physically weak to stop her. This lead him into gaining more strength, probably mostly just happened because puberty. He now due to her current actions and past actions *knocks the fuck* out of this chick, who is in fact so fucking stupid she routinely gets zeros on all of her tests **all of them**. His aggressive, pretty much assault and battery, treatment of this chick scares everyone around him especially the other chicks, but he just has no more patience for this chick who is selfish, stupid as and a **MEGA THOT** obsessed with his dick.So both extremes exist and largely played for comedy. The chicks doing it to dudes is more common but let's see western media even as a joke try to do some of the dudes not putting up with chicks bullshit.

Is it true or not?>Stating that the court had found that ""the applicant's statements had been likely to arouse justified indignation in Muslims"" and ""amounted to a generalization without factual basis"", the Strasbourg-based ECtHR said that the woman's comments could not be covered by the freedom of expression.According to wikipedia there's a source that states precisely that. guess wikipedia must be also breaking the law.>The court said it ""found in particular that the domestic courts comprehensively assessed the wider context of the applicant's statements and **carefully balanced her right to freedom of expression with the right of others to have their religious feelings protected,** and served the legitimate aim of preserving religious peace in Austria.""this is where it hits rock bottom, people can have whatever feelings they want for whatever reasons, you shouldn't be responsible for offending those feelings specially when you're stating something that is sourced.An example I've seen is how Galileo also suffered consequences for saying that the Earth orbited the Sun, that also helped protect people's feelings and preserve religious peace.At this point it's an outrage that such court ruling exists, if people can't criticize a religion or ideology then it should also should be against the law to promote such ideology as well as it might go against people's ""religious feelings"" and ""religious peace"".",1

Warm climate + rain = bacteria, meat spoils quicker. Spices act as an antiseptic. Keep food fresher longer. Protect from harmful bacteria. You know how Russians pickle Same reason, except in their cases it's the cold winters that make them do this. Gotta have some way of preserving the vegetables. European cuisine didn't mix spices too much, it usually picked just one kind and added it a little bit to preserve the original flavor. Cultures like India added them in abundance, which resulted in an explosion of flavors. And honestly? Taste is subjective. It's just food. You eat it and then poop it out. Stop treating it like some sacred thing. Enjoy that sushi burrito, put sugar in your macaroni. You're not ""ruining it"", you're discovering new flavor God, did Ratatouille not teach you anything?",1

"So here's an interesting tidbit in this article:>At GeekGirlCon this weekend in Seattle, six members of the Dungeons and Dragons team from Wizards of the Coast, the company behind D&D, described efforts to go beyond the stereotypes and appeal to more players, including women, people of color and even Each worked on the game during the development of its most recent edition, which launched in 2014.The paragraph in question doesn't say who the six women are, but later on is a picture of them, underneath which is a of the Dungeons and Dragons team spoke about their experiences working on the game and its effort to expand into more diverse player groups at GeekGirlCon in Seattle. It then names each of them: ""Left to right: Jaden Emme, Shelly Mazzanoble, Trish Yochum, Kate Irwin, Liz Schuh, Emi Tanji.""Okay, fair enough. But I wasn't familiar with most of those names, so I checked LinkedIn for their work profiles, since I was curious what role they'd played in designing D&D Fifth Edition. Here's what I found:**Jaden Emme:** I couldn't find a listing for her at all, on LinkedIn or anywhere else. I have no idea what her job title is or what role she played in developing D&D 5E.**Shelly Mazzanoble:** Author of *Confessions of a Part-Time Sorceress*, Shelly's bio on LinkedIn says that she's been an Associate Brand Manager at WotC since 1998, and moved up to Brand Manager in June of 2017. I'm suspicious of the idea that this involved much actual design or development work.**Trish Yochum:** According to her LinkedIn profile, Trish Yochum was a Senior Manager of WotC's in-house Graphic Design Group from 2000-2007, after which she apparently left the company for several other jobs as well as a long stint of She rejoined Wizards of the Coast as a Graphic Designer in April of 2018.**Kate Irwin:** Kate Irwin has been an Art Director for Wizards of the Coast since August of 2000. (Presumably this involved D&D and Magic: the Gathering both?)**Liz Schuh:** Her LinkedIn profile states that Liz Schuh has been Wizards of the Coast's Head of Publishing and Licensing for Dungeons & Dragons since August of 1995. Again, I question how much design and development this job Tanji:** Emi Tanji has, according to LinkedIn, been a Senior Graphic Designer for Wizards of the Coast since 2007, and an Art Director for WotC since February of 2018.So there you have it. Most of the women that were said to have ""worked on the game during the development of its most recent edition"" seem to have been involved with the artwork (which, to be fair, is a perennial hot-button issue for regressives) or were involved with licensing and brand management. At least one (Trish Yochum) doesn't appear to have been involved during the development period at all, unless she was an outside contract. (I don't have my 5E books with me to check.) Either way, aside from issues of the art, this really seems to be stretching the definition of ""involved.""So slightly more honest than normal for typical games journalism, I suppose.",1

We've been saying that there are 47 GENDERS (so far) which (we are claiming) is a totally different thing than ""sex"" and is probably closer to just how you want to dress and what you want to do with your free time, and having nothing to do with biological sex! lolz!""We do not have time for that shit.The entire concept of naming every combination of male clothes, female clothes, male hair, female hair, male hobbies, female hobbies is a fucking stupid waste of time.

"I have no comment on any of the articles written about the presentation, because I didn't read them. I formed my opinion by reading the presentation itself. I disagree with this video's assessment that the presentation isn't as bad as it's made out to be.The premises in the presentation are that censorship by the platform owner [is provided the rules and effects are clear, is [politically neutral, and focused on They see the platform owners as ""[hospitality I reject these premises. For one, I don't see any more a ""hospitality organizer"" than I see my email provider: they provide a service by which I may communicate with others. The standards I use to communicate with friends are vastly different than those I use for business contacts, and I neither expect nor desire those standards to be enforced by the email provider.Secondly, these providers [already see themselves as politically and focused on tone, so following those guidelines just gives us more of the same. And of course tone itself isn't politically neutral: see the censoring of the legal term [""illegal (though to their credit they appear to have backed off on that decision). Or the infamous ""gender pronouns"" debate. If I call a M2F transgender person ""he"", is that ""tone"" (and subject to censorship), ""political"" (and not subject to censorship), or a giant grey area subject to the whims of the censor and how they feel about me and/or the subject on any given day?Thirdly, being transparent about why you'e censoring someone doesn't really help the person being censored that much. We know exactly why The Daily Stormer was deplatformed: the GoDaddy CEO woke up one day and said ""I hate these guys and want them off my site"". When Alex Jones was deplatformed there were news articles and official statements on standby to tell us why it happened. When has such transparency ever answered more questions than it raised? You're still trying to polish the turd that is highly subjective standards with the shine of ""policy"" and what if I don't want these platforms to ""police tone""? So far they have a shit track record in policing their platforms; why should I trust them in the future? Earlier the presentation poses the question ""by what right do you do this?"". They try to answer it by saying ""well we'll only focus on tone"", but the question remains: ""by what right are you the arbiter of 'tone'?""Fifthly, if there is a problem with ""tone"", why enforce a top-down, one size fits all approach to it? Why not empower the users with more advanced tools to filter things themselves (or for others with their consent) without removing the ""offensive"" material from the platform. Filter lists and moderated feeds could be services provided by users, for users and under the total control (including the ability to modify filter lists, opt-in/out of them, and ultimately disable all of the end-user. That way people can tailor their experience to suit their own sensibilities rather than having one standard thrust onto everyone.Finally, I love the use of ""family friendly"" terms. When Germany censors things it's to [""make online spaces but when ""dictatorial leaders"" want to do so it's to [""improve their methods of And on the where they discuss flagging porn (which has regulations around providing access to children) and malware (which has quantifiable harmful effects) they provide a case study of The Daily Stormer (who was engaged in legal if unpopular speech) being taken off the internet, thereby trying to create a (strained) association between the three.",1

I only know about this because of the time my German friend had a party with a few family members from Germany and had a birthday cake which, in the grand norwegian tradition, had a shitton of norwegain flags on it (which raised *a lot* of eyebrows from the Germans there).So why is this to know the second meaning of the norwegian flag, you need to be either A) from certain parts of Europe or B) be familiar enough with German laws and skinheads to know about how they get around the ""don't wave around a fucking swastika you cunt"" law. And in either situation it would be bizzare that this person would not know *that it's also the fucking norwegian flag* as in A) I would hope someone in Europe would at least vaugely remember the vexiology of their own continent and in B) the use of that flag makes absolutely no sense without any context regarding Norway and Vikings and all thatAlso that's less of a halfway house and more of a ""nearly completely and just waiting for the jury to say I'm good"" house.",1

"Of course we do.>In the early-to-mid 20th century, the phrase ""politically correct"" was used to describe strict adherence to a range of ideological orthodoxies. In 1934, The New York Times reported that Nazi Germany was granting reporting permits ""only to pure 'Aryans' whose opinions are politically correct.""[2]>As Marxist-Leninist movements gained political power, the phrase came to be associated with accusations of dogmatic application of doctrine, in debates between American Communists and American Socialists. This usage referred to the Communist party line which, in the eyes of the Socialists, provided ""correct"" positions on all political matters. That is the history and that is how it is implemented today. Regardless of attempts to ~~redefine~~ mask the function, that is what it is at collective orthodoxy is *always* a problem, always really matter if the garnish is religious or ""secular"", it's still saturated in emotional beliefs rather than objective facts, and that's why it is described as pseudo-religion. It follows the same social mechanics, the fervor, the ostracization of non-believers, the denial of objective facts for the purposes of The Party, the substitution of science with rationalizations, the same manipulations of brow beating or guilt-tripping or other forms of shaming.This is one end of [PC as an example of how bad it can get. *Abject* science denialism, rejecting dissent with manipulations according to PC ""rules"".If science is ""oppressive"" then your views are not in line with reality a lot of these people are marginalized. It's just not for the reasons they claim(skin, genitals, etc). It is because they are pants on head retarded. It's that they think being ""politically correct"" has any basis in reality over being *factually correct.* For this reason, there are some times when marginalization is called for. Same reason we marginalize other stupid ideas or ideologies which have the end result of being objectively bad for society(the intent is irrelevant).Why is intent irrelevant? Because good intent often has ridiculously bad results. Contrary to what these mental midgets learned in early life, it's not just ""the thought that counts"". It's the *impact*.There's nothing but good intent behind most anti-vaxxers. They don't set out to breath new life into virtually extinct diseases, but it is a very real potential impact of their suggested plan. Nobody really thinks they're the bad guy( barring and the like, as well as some epiphany about how they've made stupid decisions that got them into the situation they're in...Why? these are statistical outliers).""The greatest trick the devil ever pulled was convincing people that he didn't exist"" bears some merit in this case, and I say this even as an atheist.

"Everyone points to Russia being the danger when it has an economy comparable to South Korea. Everything is directed at Russia when China is the one that is truly meddling with foreign affairs not just in the US and Canada but all over the world.Russia is a boogeyman that the Left prop up. While I think Russia has problems, if you look into Russian geopolitics and their history it's fairly easy to understand where they're coming from and what their motivations are. For example NATO conducts military exercises in Latvia which is right on Russia's doorstep. The US has put defensive missiles in Romania and as Putin pointed out, 'what's the difference between a defensive missile and an offensive missile? It's just the Russia and the Warsaw pact was still a thing, imagine if they managed to slowly get Central American countries into the Warsaw pact. Then they start conducting military exercises in Mexico. That'd be quite alarming for people living in America and would put them on edge.The Cold War ended in the early 90's and the USA has acted as if it never went away. Russians are merely trying to preserve their security which includes having buffer states.

My Comic Book Store Guy is fond of saying this about digital comics. For over a decade now, everyone in comics has been told that digital is the wave of the future and that paper and ink don't have long to live. Yet, every single month, the digital outlets call my CBSG and try to convince him to hawk their products. As my CBSG is fond of saying, if you don't know what the numbers are for digital comic sales (and no one does) that means they're bad, because if they were good, you would never hear the end of it and those sales numbers would be highly publicized. If you're not hearing CBS talk at great length about exactly how strong CBS all-access growth is, that means the numbers are dismal, because if the numbers were good, they would never stop talking about it. Now, it appears the first five episodes of STD season 2 went way over budget, because what was screened was received horribly and reshoots were ordered. Think Justice League, think Solo: A star wars story. Now, Les Moonves, who was the champion of STD at CBS, and those who are loyal to him on the board, are out. CBS can cancel STD and Moonves takes the entire blame, and the new board gets to write it off.
