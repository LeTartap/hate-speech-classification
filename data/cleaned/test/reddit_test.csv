"No Nut November has recently begun, and I'm sure many of you reading are along with myself. In the years past I have been hailed as a champion - for 7 straight years I have spent November as a chastitised christian. I hoped to continue this legacy. And last night, I failed.One as regal as I, failing? Impossible. Only the gods could achieve such power to stop me. I guess that night I was dealing with a god.I'm on the YouTube homepage, trying to find some epic Morgz videos, when I stumble upon a certain video. This damn video. Its bright thumbnail, its captivating title - it utterly fascinated me. This cursed video: it was none other than “Fortnite's most EPIC event EVER!”, posted by the one and only Ali A.My body immediately began to shake, and my penis shot straight up. The most EPIC event EVER? What could it be? I felt a pull towards the video like I had never felt before. It took me awhile to realize the effect the video was having on me. I fell back in my chair in fear. In agony. In complete and utter despair.My hand grabbed the mouse and began to slowly slide over to the thumbnail. I kicked and screamed and cried, trying and failing to stop my body. Sweat was dripping down my entire body. Minutes later, the pointer had finally reached its And with a cry, the hand that didn't feel like mine anymore clicked.I was immediately met with a scream. “THIS IS IT LADIES AND GENTLEMEN!” Purple light streamed from the computer monitor and began to fill the room. The voice on the screen continued talking, seemingly in an ancient tongue. My entire body began to quiver as something awakened inside of me. My speakers began to shake as something inside of them grew louder. Was this music? Or was this something else?The music finally picked up, and as Ali's intro began, I came harder and faster than I ever had before. The sensation rendered me The last thing I remember seeing that night was my cum streaked over his face. And it looked like he was smiling.I woke up to a rising sun. My clothes were back on, my sweat was wiped away, and my penis was flaccid. I could finally see again. Was this all a dream? No, there’s no way. It felt too real.My suspicions were immediately crushed as I looked to the monitor. In a drunk stupor, it looks like I had changed my desktop background to a picture of him. He was staring into my heart - into my soul. And he was covered in my cum.So, guys, whatever you do, don’t watch Ali A's newest video. Anybody less powerful than I would surely be dead.

Not like she tried to choke him to death or do any real damage, which is more restrained than I'd want to be.There's no humiliation in getting choked out by a woman you weren't even fighting back against, clearly she is capable. You're not bad at your job just because your brain needs oxygen.> According to the news story, there is video evidence that shows that the guy she choked out was innocent, and it was in fact her friend that grabbed or smacked her ass. She is still proud of the fact that she choked out someone who was innocent. Most of her twitter followers, and society is no different, think it's funny, she is a hero, and more of this should happen.She probably hadn't seen that yet, and left thinking she'd choked out her attacker.If I choked out Brock Lesnar over a case of mistaken identity, I'd still be pretty impressed with myself to be honest. I hope he'd have the goodwill to forgive me that on top of the mistake itself.",0

">Simply not true. You do know absolutely everything that was on the sub was archived for public record off of reddit right?>how many calls to violence against Trump and his supporters on left wing subs should be tolerated before they are banned too?None. You have a report button just like the rest of us. Use it. When you see such things send it straight to the admins. All you are saying by pointing this out is your lot are two fucking lazy to report anything. Do you actually think for one second volunteer mods on this sub actually read every single post on their subs. This sub that I run, that you are in, that was on the list, who sees trolls non stop every single day mostly libtards, with 180k If it does not get reported it does not exist to me. Same thing goes with the admins a million fold. >If I go on and call for Trump to be killed, should they be banned too?Ah see this is where your lack of of how reddit works is showing. Your example can and does apply to PPD exactly and what we as a sub have dealt with since day 1 of the sub and as such something I have intimate knowledge of. We as a sub have a topic and SJWs have tried to get us banned by doing just what you say. In fact there have been multiple attempts to false flag this sub. Pretty much a daily So why have we not been banned and other subs have. Simple. We mods here are not idiots. So if you came in here and said lets kill trump we as a sub are not guilty of breaking any reddit rules and so should not be banned. The comment itself is against reddit rules but the sub has not broken reddit rules. So the sub should not be banned. !00% totally agree.So where did things go wrong for the subs that got content was not illegal which we both agree. The sub mods are not for what is posted there by others with maybe malicious intent. Agreed. So where they went wrong is the mods joined in on reddit rule breaking activity. Just that simple. That one little fact is the kicker. So say for example I broke reddit rules The admins wont straight up ban me or anyone else. You get warned to check your shit. If I continue to break the rules I will catch a ban. If I am the only mod in the sub to do it they will remove me as mod. Happened countless times so far with reddit. If all the mods break the rules the sub gets killed. Countless subs have been ended because of this. By no means all trump subs have been killed. T_D anyone? If after a sub is killed spin off subs pop up those get killed as well.There is no conspiracy at all. The people who created the lead sub to get killed in all of this were not very smart. They got their sub killed. Just like if I was an idiot and the other mods were this sub would be long gone. If anything you should be mad at the dumb cunts who took the topic that should be on reddit up so bad they got themselves and the sub kicked.",0

"Reading the study, a lot of the supposed identifying features of ""Russian trolls"" sound like people from 4chan.>16 of these 33 troll/sock puppet accounts appear to be Russian trolls, or at least possess several of the Russian troll presented above. 7 of the 16 had auto-generated handles consisting of a very common, English name followed by a series of seemingly random digits, and five of those seven had not uploaded a profile image, a combination which according to the studies mentioned above, is a typical characteristic of Russian troll accounts.Those usernames are the ones *Twitter itself* autogenerates if you don't bother to come up with a username when you make an account. Not mentioning this reflects either gross ignorance or example of an account that almost sums up these Russian troll carries an auto-generated handle and has almost exclusively tweeted disparagingly about The Last Jedi, and engaged in “anti-SJW” rhetoric. In the middle of these tweets, the account all of a sudden tweeted in support of Donald Trump during the latter’s visit to the United Kingdom, which was met with large protests in London. Besides not containing any personal information, having no profile picture and other Russian troll this account only posted 9 tweets in more than a year from its creation in January 2017 to February 2018, all of them regarding a particular Anime series on YouTube. From April 2018 onwards, during the lead-up to the release of The Last Jedi for the home video market, and in anticipation of Solo: A Star Wars Story opening, the account suddenly comes to life and begins tweeting frequently about The Last Jedi, identity politics and Rian Johnson. After the data was collected, the account has been through a “reset” where many of its public tweets have been deleted, leaving only its replies.Gee, I wonder if there's any other demographic besides paid shills for the Russian government who don't care about Twitter enough to bother making a username or uploading a profile picture, value their privacy enough to not upload personal information and to periodically purge tweets, dislike SJWs, like Donald Trump, dislike TLJ, and like anime.>One of the accounts which has now been deleted by Twitter exhibited some of the lingual that researchers have observed in Russian troll tweets. On July 11, tweeted: “So, now explain why Mark Hamil didn't like Luje in TLJ?”. The simplicity and brevity of the language, as well as the fact that this purported Star Wars fan doesn’t spell “Hamill” or “Luke” correctly, are all indicators that raises suspicions. In combination with other handle, lack of personal matter on account etc.), the verbiage suggests that the user may be a Russian troll. The literature suggests that Russian trolls primarily use mobile apps for Twitter posts, and thus auto-correct and word suggestion on smartphones disguise any poor English skills to an extent.J and K are next to each other in the English keyboard layout.

Rueda published another study in which they took a sample of 103 young adults and had them solve a ""frustration task."" Separating the participants into four groups, the researches had one group play no video game, one play a non-violent video game, one play as good guys in a violent game, and one play as bad guys in a violent game. They found that the games had no impact on aggressive behavior whatsoever, and that **the group which played no game at all was the most aggressive** after the task, whereas **the group that played the violent games were the least hostile and depressed.** So far there's no evidence that suggests that violent videogames actually make people more violent, but there is an implication that video games (including violent ones) might be making people less violent.",0

"Her own facebook post, ran through google translate and might need some more adjustment - but anyone reading this should compare it to the actual movie above. Its WITH HATE CRIME MOTIVE On January 11, 2018, I was on my way home from work at 5.30pm. I was in a hurry to get the son from school closing at 18pm. I'm in a hurry, the train is coming soon. walk through the barriers. A white middle-aged man in front of me, turns around and stops me in the middle of the barriers and says to me ""go on your own card."" I stand between the barriers, they hit me hard in my back. He blocks my way. I ""But I have a card"", and is about to show him, but there is no time to do it.In the next moment, I feel how he grabs me with both arms, squeezes me hard into a corner at the latches, pushes his knee to my body, preventing me from touching and holding me with both arms. I get scared! I push him away with all my power. He gets pissed off and says ""damn dirty N-word hora"" while pushing me so hard that I trip through the barriers. A black man runs forward and tells the white man to stop ""Beat a Woman"".I'm both afraid, angry, offended, shocked, sad and desperate. The man continues to call me N word hora. I defend myself, strikes back! I refuse to be violated, afraid and depressed. Everything is recorded on video.The man reports me for abuse and I am making a counter notification of abuse of hatred motives. A week ago, I received a letter home that my application was canceled but the husband's application to me is not I'm suspected of abuse. My report is closed because, according to the police, ""it lacks objective evidence of support"". The male's application is not laid down !!The police's racism has already determined that he (white man about 185 cm) is the victim, and I (black woman about 163 cm) is above, despite defending myself in distresses and the man started the attack on me from nowhere!It's me who has back injuries, was hospitalized because of shock, got sick, got colleagues who follow me to the track because I'm afraid to meet the man.It's me who was attacked by unknown white man in the subway, and subjected to an afrophobic hate crime. The police never investigated my notification as a hate crime and they never registered the hate crime scene before my notification was Sweden, about 25% of all racist hatred is avrophobic. The most common hate crime against black people is a violent crime of unknown white man. I am one of those victims who carry on the damage of racism, afrophobia and hate crime that the police are kidding in.I am tired of the racism of the police, everyday racism, hatred and threats against black / brown people. I'm tired of 34 years in Sweden, to constantly bear the blame and become a victim of society's structural racism that permeates all authorities. I am sad that we who are exposed to racism never get settled. But the game must go on !!! SHARE GET! """,1

If this was a man you wouldn't cry misandry, the misogyny doesn't make sense. A person is a person. They obviously tried to cuff her and she resisted. This is the next step. Police aren't going to take risks infront of a crowd with agressive people trying to hurt them, male or female. Killings by cop aren't common at all in Holland, like i said this is not the USA. It very rarely happens, not even one this year. The 6 cops were there for crowd control, as you can clearly see in the video. This is standard procedure. As little as possible arrest while the others make sure the crowd disperses. Cops won't use excessive force on me or a loved one as, like i said, cops are the most respected and trusted authority in the country. They score higher than other people and even neighbours. Things like this are very rare and excessive force therefore even more. She could walk and stand fine, there was no excessive force here, just the most efficient way to handle the situation. Even if the arrest wasn't correct, she abused the cop. The arrest can be wrong all you want, we both don't know, but because she abused the cop this was completely legal and no one will even look into it guarenteed.

"For fair comparison here, you had likely kissed your grandmother prior to her death, so it serves as precedent that kissing is acceptable. It wouldn't be acceptable for Superman to come through a portal and do it though, because he didn't know her and hadn't kissed her before.In the case of from what I recall of the movie they had not kissed. Reading the summary, she was singing ""I'm Wishing"", he joined her song without consent, then launched into ""One Song"". The ""fell in love"" part seems like speculation, unless this was specified in the novelization.The dead being ""beloved"" isn't really grounds enough. Lots of people loved Princess Diana for example but that wouldn't be ground to let them all come and kiss her. This would be reserved for those who were already close with her.The question is whether or not Snow and the prince were close enough to warrant this. The basis appears to be that Snow might have made googly eyes at him.The full extent of their relationship appears to have lasted less than 2 minutes: does smile at him, though I don't know if he could see it from down there. She does fluff up her hair, but that's done standing behind a curtain which he certainly couldn't see... she kisses a dove on the mouth (yuck!) and it flies down and lands on his hand... Honestly, based on body language alone, the dove probably offered more consent cues than Snow did, it blushed so hard the red shone through its white feathers, what a slut!Snow is beaming as she closes the curtains... but the more I look at that mouth the weirder it looks, could easily be a smile TBH.

"KIA history lesson for you kiddos:Rule 3 has been around ever since KIA was flooded with retarded off-topic threads, which was met with a counter flood if meta threads bitching about all the off-topic spam to the mods. I was there. I remember. Apparently the rest of you have memories of goldfish or some shit.Some loosely worded ""no off topic"" prohibitions were introduced at that time, alongside the self-post rule for good measure. The problem was this didn't satisfy either side; people kept bitching about the off topic shit and other people started bitching their shit was removed.The point system was introduced to clarify what exactly was considered on topic or off topic. Reportedly, there had been transparency issues; some threads were removed for one reason, others stayed up despite clearly violating the same rule. It ultimately depended on how the individual mod interpreted the rules. People complained. Fair enough. So a point system was introduced; people were given exactly what the rules were going to be and told point blank that the mods would be enforcing them to the letter. Or more KIA discussed and proposed the new rules and then voted on them in a series of meta threads. With transparent rules, everyone would be on the same page when they submitted their thread. And mods would not be applying any personal judgment when enforcing them; they would remove things that violated the rules because that's what the community decided and they wanted to forestall the mods had people literally vote on a new point system, because the mods *actually* enforced the existing point system blindly and to the letter, which was exactly what they had promised. And as it turned out, the point system wasn't flexible enough to cover all edge cases, which meant a lot of seemingly on-topic shit was removed and some arguably off-topic shit passed. Cue conspiritard nonsense about nazi mods. Mods don't enforce rules Nazi mods. Mods do enforce rules leading to unfortunate unintended results? Nazi mods. This was *despite* the fact that the point system was literally hashed out and voted on by verified KIA members.So people voted on a more relaxed point system including a return to the self post rule. And that's where we are today: a nice, comfortable middleground after years of pendulum swinging back and forward in response to listening to those bitching about nazi mods and spam.So no, rule 3 doesn't exist for mods to be cunts. Rule 3 exists because the mods stopped listening to divisive, polarizing, D&C, faggotry. **And good riddance for that.** Dozens of popped out of the woodwork before, during, after the last round of voting and the mods literally stopped paying attention to them. Feeding trolls only makes them hungrier and noisier. The more attention they gave these people, the more they fucking whined and bitched and accused them of being Nazis.",0

"Prosecutors have decided not to charge Long Beach Councilwoman Jeannine Pearce with domestic violence or driving under the influence in connection with a June clash with her former chief of staff.But a district attorney’s memo detailing the decision also raises questions about the Long Beach Police Department’s response to the June 3 incident involving the councilwoman and Devin Cotter.In its initial statement, the Police Department said it received a call for assistance from the California Highway Patrol about a possible drunk driving incident on the shoulder of the 710 Freeway in Long Beach at 2:40 a.m.The city’s officers smelled alcohol on Pearce, who admitted to drinking that night, according to the district attorney’s memo. A field sobriety test conducted about 4 a.m. showed she was mildly impaired.But the memo said a test of the councilwoman’s blood-alcohol level was not conducted until 4:20 a.m., nearly two hours after the CHP called. At that point, the test showed Pearce had a blood-alcohol level of 0.06%, under the legal limit of 0.08%, the memo said.The testing device used on Pearce was unreliable, the prosecutor’s memo said. A department toxicologist had recommended it not be used a month before the incident. Additional tests were not performed, according to the district attorney’s memo.A police spokesman said in a statement that officers initially investigated whether domestic violence had occurred when they arrived, interviewing Cotter and Pearce before realizing that the councilwoman had been drinking. At that point, the officers called for a colleague who is a certified drug recognition expert to investigate, Sgt. Brad Johnson said in the statement.He said the testing device had been “tagged to be replaced but was not removed from its storage cabinet. The officer who retrieved the device did not realize ... and unfortunately used it during the DUI at the scene saw Cotter with swelling, redness and a cut to his head and cuts to his hand, according to the district attorney’s memo. Pearce at one point had shoved Cotter, causing him to fall to the ground, the memo ultimately decided that Pearce, who was elected to the City Council in 2016, could argue she was defending herself when she shoved Cotter.In an email to The Times, Pearce said Cotter had thrown her “keys, iPad, and many other things” off to the side of the road during the argument on the freeway shoulder. Asked about the delay in time between the arrival of responding officers and the administering of a sobriety test, Pearce said she was questioned about the confrontation with Cotter for “some time” while the investigators were “waiting on someone that was bringing the who could not be reached for comment, served as campaign manager for Mayor Robert Garcia when he was elected in 2014 and later served as a legislative deputy to him until July 2016, according to Cotter’s LinkedIn page. He then left to work as Pearce’s chief of staff until February 2017. Pearce and Cotter had “dated before, during and after” the June 3 incident, according to the district attorney’s memo.The two had been driving back from a concert, where both had been drinking, when the altercation occurred, according to the memo. An argument ensued, and Pearce struck Cotter on the arm because he was “causing the car to dangerously swerve” on the freeway, the memo said.Both gave “multiple inconsistent statements and thus both have proved to be inaccurate reporters of fact,” Deputy Dist. Atty. Janis Johnson wrote in the memo. But evidence supported the councilwoman’s final version of the events over Cotter’s, Johnson the evidence was a text message Pearce sent to her new chief of staff asking for help and a video the councilwoman took that showed Cotter yelling a threat to release disparaging information about her to “the press, her husband and her employer if she did not meet certain demands while holding her car keys,” Johnson wrote.Long Beach police previously said officers did not find “sufficient cause” to arrest either Pearce or Cotter at the scene. Pearce was driven home by a friend, according to police, and Cotter was taken home by the responding tried to confront Pearce again hours later outside her home, the councilwoman said. He was arrested on suspicion of public intoxication a short time later, according to police.In a statement released earlier this year, Pearce said she had been the victim of domestic violence in the months before the incident and that police were investigating, though she did not accuse anyone by name.“Since late last year I have experienced escalating threats, harassment and stalking,” she wrote.Pearce said those incidents remain under investigation by Long Beach police, and she declined to elaborate Thursday. She also expressed frustration that she had been cast as the aggressor in the incident.“I find it frustrating that as the one that called [police], that was trapped, and was faced with fear that I was listed as the only suspect in the matter. This is one example of the challenges for women (and even men) in speaking up about psychological abuse,” Pearce wrote in the email. “The burden of proof is not a bruise on the outside, ones easily seen.”Pearce has said she was not “pulled over” June 3, but had requested a police presence at the scene. Earlier this year, CHP’s Southern Division Chief Chris O’Quinn told The Times that his officers came upon Pearce and Cotter because they were involved in a “heated argument” on the side of the freeway.Long Beach officers have closed their investigation into the June 3 incident, according to a statement released Wednesday. The district attorney’s Public Integrity Division is still conducting a separate investigation into “alleged inappropriate activity and conflicts of interest” in connection with the incident. A spokesman for the district attorney’s office declined to elaborate.",1

">The Peculiar History of the “Negro-Ape representations of African peoples are nearly asold as Europeans’ first contact with West Africa (Ovington, 1929).Early European maritime writings described primitive people whoseemed more closely related to apes than to White explorers(Dapper, 1688). As theories of race moved from theological tobiological, the rationale for racial hierarchy relied even moreheavily on the “Negro-ape metaphor,” as Lott (1999) described it.Although this linkage predates scientific racism, it drew increasedinterest and popularity when Franz Boas, the preeminent anthro-pologist of his time, and even Charles Darwin, speculated thatthere might be an evolutionary spectrum among primates (Lott,1999) containing monkeys and apes at the least evolved end,continuing through savage and/or deformed anthropoids, and cul-minating with Whites at the other end (as most evolved; Jahoda,1999).

Being underage and in possession of alcohol is a crime (MIC). When a police officer has reasonable suspicion or probable cause of a person committing a crime, that suspect MUST identify themselves to the police. They gave her the chance to show that an overage person was the one with the alcohol, which not only did she not take, but she was really rude to them when they were very patient with her trashy, belligerent, entitled behavior. If you refuse to identify yourself at this point, you can be arrested - period. By trying to walk away, she's and when she pushes the officer, now it's resisting arrest AND felony assaulting a police officer in addition to the MIC. Then when she kicks the other cop (another count of assaulting a police officer), they treated her like they would any man, and rightly so. Lastly, when she tried (and failed) to spit on the officer, that's yet ANOTHER count of attempted assault of a police officer, as bodily fluids count in that category.On top of that, the whole time she is screaming about how her child is there, using that child as a shield, etc., but the worst part is that's the example she's setting for her kid.",0

"true - but it all depends on what kind of person you are. Sure, a good ol' kuncle sammich would be well deserved and justified after trying to kick him in the balls - but then he has to deal with the whether they be from his higher ups or from society, not to mention himself. I was a bouncer for years and had this sort of thing arise on a near monthly basis - and I could never bring myself to dish out a nap to some dumb twat, even if they were begging for it. It would really take me being in some sort of danger to make myself to straight up punch a woman (or tiny dude) in the face. I usually just sort of kept them away from me or grabbed wrists while blowing up the radio for some backup. More often than not there was a cop standing right near us or within shouting distance up the street that would be there - and I always felt like if I sort of hammed it up like ""please, miss, you have to go, please!"", it would make them look worse in the eyes of the cop.",0

"The process for me started with the general snarky tones of games journalists on podcasts. I heard one whine about a co-host using the word crazy and I found it absurd. I also didn't like the dismissive and self centered way they were speaking about the next (current console generation) going all digital as if people who couldn't afford/don't have access to high speed internet were Luddites holding society back. It was very San Francisco elitist. When ME3 occurred I was more on the side of journalists. And I even today I still day expecting Bioaware to change the ending is fully on retarded and no chimping out is going to convince me that outrage mobs should force artists to change their production. Get angry and warn others all you want but demanding a change? It happened, get over it and don't buy the next Bioware game.But out of that incident were reports of people getting on the case of one of the writers and I don't think people should have harassed her but iirc she was sort of flippant and snarky, but all the outlets white knighted cause wamen and that didn't sit well with me. I wasn't at gamergate ground zero so when I heard of it, I immediately dismissed it as a bunch of spergs crying because some game was in 59 fps instead of 60 fps or other such typical gamer nonsense. However by that time I was tired of gaming press becoming more and more adversarial and making more and more petty, disingenuous complaints so I decided to give GG an earnest look. Additionally I started seeing comic pros act u professional and normie fans were applauding while clutching at their pearls because you could see Ms. Marvel's thighs.I also didn't like the way I was see more and more judging history based on the oh so enlightened ideals of today.Some time around this time during a State of the Union President Obama (whom I was a fan of at the time) mentioned the wage gap which didn't sit right. I assumed he wasn't mistaken but I couldn't see how it was legal. And if it's illegal how are these very public companies very publicly getting away with it? From that I saw some Youtube vids of people I wasn't normally interested in, including a 2 hour binge of TL;DR on a road trip.

"Look up the state laws on requirements to file a complaint, and compare that to the literal hundreds of videos where LEO officials tell outright lies to people inquiring about the process. A sworn statement can be used as a legal document against you in a court of law, and most likely will. That's why there is a legal standard that elected officials felt the need to legislate regarding the complaint process against LEOs. So the LEOs don't retaliate. I am still calling the lady in the story a cunt who deserves what she gets, BUT, anyone reading who wants to file a legitimate complaint against an LEO, should NEVER , EVER, sign a notarized and sworn document to complain against an LEO. There is no possibility that any half sane lawyer in existence would disagree with me. The cops purposely trick people into signing legal documents, flouting the law. They literally intimidate people out of ever filing anything, with the easy threats that they can arrange for ten officer witnesses to contradict the complainant's document and use it to prosecute them, and the person leaves the station, and forgets about filing anything again, in their life. Thus the specific legislations in all the states regarding LEO complaint processes that every state felt the dire need to enact into law to make sure people are not badgered into filing legal documents, or intimidated out of complaining. Why else would they feel the need to waste all of that time and money constructing such legislation? Once again, fuck the lady in the story, and yay for good and honest cops who do not try and trick people. Here's an example. California state law. ''Providing Personal Information. You do not have to provide the personal information requested. If you do not wish to provide personal information, such as your name, home address, or home telephone number, you may remain anonymous.'' Notarized requirements as stated by most police departments in complain audit videos are illegal, but qualified immunity allows them to openly lie about the process at will with zero repercussions. Watch your ass folks, and IANAL, so talk to the best one you can find if you ever have to complain about an officer. Fuck the lady in the OP story.",0

He pushed her away then arrested her for telling him to not (illegally) put his hands on her. He never told her what she is under arrest for, and never read her any Miranda Rights; that is an unlawful arrest in many and you can literally kill a cop for that, as stated by plenty of legal precedence. The slam to the floor was absolutely excessive, which is illegal in any Also, in any a cop must witness you commit a crime, or have reasonable suspicion that you have committed a crime. She had not committed any crime aside from not moving on from the public space when told to. That does not warrant a slam to the floor.The cop did things wrong and needlessly escalated the situation. I mean, if his goal was to impress everyone there by showing his huge ~~penis~~ authority, then mission but otherwise, he fucked up.

"> In fact, conflicts are worse than ever before. No, they aren't. We're actually experiencing an unprecedented peace. are you getting your information from, the fearmongers at Fox, Brietbart, and Rebel?> The thing you fail to recognize is that everyone subconsciously understands this ranking of races that I just outlined, and that even within the small minority of interracial marriages they overwhelmingly trend towards people who are genetically white, or appear more white.The original question was simply whether different ethnicities are mingling or staying clustered, and the INCREASING intermarriages shows they are in fact INCREASINGLY mingling. You challenged my claim, but you're not addressing that point at all. What you're doing is injecting your own White supremacist argument, which also misses the point. Marriage is largely an economic decision, and since economics have artificially broken along ethnic lines, we would expect preferences for stable economic partners to manifest as preference for ""Whiter"" spouses. Likewise, if Blacks are being persecuted with so many of their young men thrown behind bars and denied equity in society, then that likely artificially affects their desirability as mates. This economic factor would explain why Black men with more education intermarry more. Or, a culture of racism (even subconscious) rather than accurate ranking might cause people to prefer White mates. How many families explicitly/implicitly make it difficult for someone to bring home a Black gf/bf? Or, there are just more White people. But whatever the reason, they are mingling, so my point stands. What your argument also fails to address is the fact that, until fairly recently, plenty of genetically and apparently similar groups, like the Irish and Italians, weren't considered White. And South Asians, who are genetically Caucasian, aren't usually considered White. Therefore, ""Whiteness"" itself is largely a social construct, not some inherent ranking system like you're saying. > I guess racism is correct.At least you have the courage to say what you believe. A shame you lack the wisdom to see you're wrong. Seriously, though, does it frustrate you that more people who agree with you aren't willing to be honest about what they believe? Some people seem more offended at being called racist than they are at actually being racist. Do you feel that r/metacanada is a place where your beliefs are generally supported? If not, then why not? > Wrong, inequality is not an analog measure, it is an infinite fractal and inadmissible as a scientific ranking.I could have been more precise in saying economic inequality within communities drives crime, which is the consensus among the research. > It showed that for violent crime the impact of inequality is large, even after controlling for the effects of poverty, race, and family composition. Although most crimes are committed by the most disadvantaged members of society, these individuals face greater pressure and incentives to commit crime in areas of high inequality. that link better?)Do you have any actual peer-reviewed, credible research to show that ethnicity itself drives crime? While you're looking for that, you'll notice the consensus agrees with me. > Yeah, because increased police presence is an deterrent to crime. Perhaps, but the best way to predict the size of a police force in Canada is the presence of minorities, not the actual crime rate. That means the reason for the increased presence isn't to deter actual crime, but to respond to an imagined threat of crime that does not actually exist. Completely the opposite of what you're saying here: > BECAUSE THE INCREASED POLICE PRESENCE IN MINORITY AREAS IS BECAUSE THOSE MINORITIES COMMIT MORE CRIMES.You're simply asserting what you're trying to argue (begging the question) which is the opposite of what the evidence clearly says. Why do you keep dodging the point at hand? Baltimore only shows how inequality with corrupt police create a vicious cycle of violence and mistrust. The police there intentionally made their communities more dangerous to prove their own value. It's like when police stop writing tickets to starve the government of funds during labour disputes. That's simply self-serving stupidity, not a case against the expansive research on the actual causes of crime. > You did not. Multicultural cities have more crime, especially interracial crime. Especially crime where blacks assault whites and other blacks. They are uniformly more violent than every other race and ethnicity. Stop sidestepping this blatantly obvious fact.That's not true at all. I keep giving you evidence, and you respond with invective. Toronto is both one of the most multicultural cities in the world, and one of the safest. Take a look at some recent data from across Canada. The top of those lists aren't the most multicultural places. They are places like in Alberta where they rely on boom/bust economies, which exacerbate economic inequality. The data shows otherwise.No, you're just refusing to look at the data that doesn't fit your worldview. You're being uncritical and dogmatic. As for the benefits of diversity: > Diversity is a key driver of innovation and is a critical component of being successful on a global scale.Senior executives are recognizing that a diverse set of experiences, perspectives, and backgrounds is crucial toinnovation and the development of new ideas. When asked about the relationship between diversity and innovation,a majority of respondents agreed that diversity is crucial to encouraging different perspectives and ideas thatfoster innovation. You literally said diversity is a strength, you fucking retard.But I said, as you quote but don't seem to comprehend: > I'm not saying ""diversity at all costs,""Saying something is a strength doesn't mean that you want it AT ALL COSTS. It's generally good to be strong, but not if it means taking steroids that will shrivel my balls up and make me emotional and aggressive. Diversity is strength, but that doesn't mean we should place incompetent people in important positions just to satisfy diversity quotas. It means, everything else equal, it's generally better to have diverse skills, backgrounds, and perspectives. The data -- if you don't shy away from it -- shows that to be true.",0

"I should’ve specified that I meant within the confines of the law. self defense. If a girl or guy comes up to me and slaps me hard just once, and doesn’t engage further, it would not be self defense for me to strike them back (at least where I live).There were a couple of times where one of my girlfriends got really angry at me and started punching me as hard as she could, repeatedly. One time was while I was driving and she was hitting my arms and body. I was allowing it because it really didn’t hurt, and after a few seconds she kept escalating and scratched me. At that point I could’ve smacked her asleep, but I pushed her back with my arm and got loud. Then I said “I’m gonna fucking hurt us both, watch this” and started speeding towards a light pole. Scared her shitless. If she hadn’t stopped when I pushed her back and raised my voice, I would’ve hit her to make her stop. The other time she got on top of me while I was in bed fresh out of the hospital with a sprained foot, and she got on top of me and started gorilla smashing my chest and arms. Didn’t hurt at all, but she had every intention of hurting me, and kept going until I stopped it with my voice.If she wasn’t my girlfriend though and did the same thing in both situations, she would’ve been smacked hard once, and punched hard after if she continued.

"In America it will largely come down to a challenge for the first person that doesn't settle with a plea deal. Like with the masturbatory aid bans, which were also predicated on obscenity, it requires a court challenge to overturn obviously prohibitions on 1st amendment speech.Also, to anyone claiming ""muh 10th amendment,"" that only works for powers not already delegated to the people/fed. The 1st amendment, like the 2nd, is largely inviolable and cannot be constrained by state law just because they vote to do it. The states don't have the right to curtail 1st amendment speech that is guaranteed by the Constitution at large. Just because they regularly do, doesn't mean it doesn't also regularly get overturned after lengthy court battles.This is why states like California routinely get slapped by the Supreme Court for gross acts.As a further on this, keep in mind that ""nudie mags"" as a whole were considered illegal in the United States until recently, as far as history is concerned. When you see people say that something is illegal, you have to keep in mind that while the State may find it illegal, it doesn't mean that the court will when forced to examine it. Obscenity laws have been dying a slow death of a million court battles for decades, and no higher court *wants* to rule on something being an obscenity or not, because then they will have to once and for all define what an obscenity is without completely trashing the 1st amendment, a feat that they simply can't do, since the Miller test is the most ambiguous and ill-defined standard applicable.As a passing last time edit, obscenity law reflects possibly the last gasp of moralism in United States common law. The great majority of laws focus on the verifiable parties involved with a dispute, the verifiable harm or offense committed, and the verifiable damage of said acts. There is a lack of passion, or focus on right or wrong, in law. There is only what happened, and the facts about what happened. Only in the resolution of a trial does the depravity of a person's conscience in committing acts sway the punishment of those acts. But obscenity is ill-defined, lacks any victims, cannot be tied to a particular public act, and criminalizes the conscience of the accused. It is only ""wrong"" because others are offended by it. No act of deprivation is tied to its existence, nobody is harmed by its creation or and it can only be illegal because the State is making a moral stand. If anything, the world would be better by removing this topic from the State's hands once and for all.Obscenity law is the SJW's wet dream as created by the extreme right. There is functionally no difference between hate speech as envisioned by the extreme left, and obscenity law as crafted by the extreme right.",1

This is the same kind of bullshit reporting that led everybody to believe the wage-gap myth. I would expect nothing better from the shambles which is the current state of the New York Times. The comparison of mens’ and womens’ penalties as an argument that one sex or the other is being against is ridiculous. You really need to know how often they break the rules vs how often they are penalized. A comparison of that ratio for each sex would tell you if there was really any favoritism.,1
Do you have anything more than a skimming of the Wikipedia or a 100 level legal course worth of knowledge to argue the reason why a legal system has a right to punish I'm all ears. >Crime of speaking ones mindIf you want to argue the legitimacy of the crime that's perfectly reasonable; since that's how Western legal systems work in general. But don't go saying that the courts don't have a legal right to punish you because you don't agree with the crime because that's dumb.Fining for harassment is an punishment for harassment by a beneficial state.,0

"This is something that echoes a bit with me as you see the same thing between tech industry and science. Employers love to write off long work days to be something proud about but to me it's really exploitable and just a deep flaw of various cultures (it's a global phenomenon, really). On reddit, far too often when I warn peope to not simply accept working 60+ hours on a 40h a week contract, they get very defensive and claim everyone else is lazy.The 40h/week standard is that way for a good reason. You need a healthy work-life balance. You will likely be busy enough just having a household and aside from that your brain and body need to rest. To push your body beyond without receiving extra payment and the choice to refuse is But it not this way, especially not for startups in science and tech both and also academic positions, already starting at the PhD level. Hell, I too am expecting to graduate with my doctorate in a little over a month, but I for sure had 50-60h on average for a 40h a week contract. It is the norm despite seemingly scamtastic. Two things need to happen: we need to stop glorifying destroying yourself physically and mentally for the pockets of your employer and people need to unionize more or start getting more with programs which protect worker's rights. Germany has good unions, but the same cannot be said of france, NL and the US. And especially for you americans out there: I as a european cannot believe that you can find work without having a legal contract! Making it mandatory to have a contract should be the first step in making things better. A contract is not there to limit you. It is a way to protect your rights and prevent your employer from exploiting you. You have a legal document you can at all times refer back to and nobody can debate it. In france (and I think NL too) at the very least for overtime you are obliged to be paid extra. People I know let me know that sometimes they are send home after their 8h shift is over purely due to the fact that the employer does not want to pay them more. Edit: Due to some comments on this: Of couse it's very reasonable to have a crunch busy period and expect to work a lot, then have periods where you are not busy at all. I am not saying we shouldn't ever have crunch periods. However, we should avoid them when we can and not encourage employers to chronically understaff because they know they can get away with long term giving people 60h work weeks on 40h contracts.",1

"This could be a little incoherent because I don't sleep much these daysI say that gatekeeping is good and proper. People build a little community the way they like it, and would prefer to keep it that way. It makes sense and is natural. Why would they want someone(s), who were not involved in the building, to come along and take advantage of what was created and then change how it is to suit the newcomer's taste? Which is essentially what's happened with any nerd fandom you were made fun of for in high school but now everyone wears the t-shirt because it's en vogueTo use your example of ""doesn't want smelly girls in their boys-only pillow fort"", how many of you, when you were kids, were forced to include someone you don't really like/know into your game, and they go about changing it or members of the group do so the newcomer I remember we were basically doing DnD LARPing when we were 10 or so and a kid the principal forced us to let him play with us didn't really get it. But he did watch the Kevin Sorbo Hercules show so he just wanted to be Hercules and beat shit up. Or a girl who turns your super hero fights into playing houseBut the more important question, I think, is how hard it is to get past the gatekeeper. In my experience, it's usually really easy to disarm people by asking genuine questions to show interest, and people generally like to feel like their opinions or knowledge are worth sharing. If you ask enough questions, and play some games to put the answers to those questions into play, suddenly you are a genuine member of the fandom, or you lose interest and leave, instead of being someone screaming at the gates to be let in come hell or high water, BAMNThat being said, gatekeepers should remain at the gates, and not wander around trying to test everyone. Speak only when spoken to about the topic and all that. And there are always more zealous you'll always find someone who has absurdly high standards before accepting you as a true member of the fandom. The important thing is that not everyone is like that. It's always annoying how quick people are to deny having traits attributed to a large group of people, yet are just as quick to assume everyone part of a group of people are all the same. I am sick unto death of all these ""x fandom is the most toxic fanbase ever"" type the more people that get added to a group, the more things get watered down. I don't know if it always has to be that way, but as far as I've it always has been so far. There is definitely a difference between hardcore gamers, casual gamers and people who fuck around on their phones. And if you like your gacha games, or your easy modes, or if wanting to gouge your eyes out is a normal part of a game's then that's fine. You do you. You don't HAVE to be a part of every cool thing that comes along, every trend and fad. Gaming is founded on git gud, same as sports, and I don't hear people wailing about needing to lower the skill level in sports. If you can't git gud in gaming, then become a spectatorSo keep gatekeeping so your preferred thing stays spicy, before it gets watered down to tasteless paste",1

The only things I use are non-debatable facts like sex/gender, age etc. politics and in my case sexuality is more complicated than slapping a label at it and declaring myself that Plus I find feminists annoying as hell, and to often be obnoxious, and I believe any group that exists to be against another group to have little purpose or meaning beyond ""yeah, we disagree with that""",0

This is important cause VICE is leading the charge against RDR2 and the whole killing the feminist thing (and against gamers in general) This corporation is evil and degenerate and they are social justice warriors in a place of power and influence. As a community that cares about games and free speech I would expect that we all take militant stances against VICE and never cower or apologize or give in to their mob outrage.

"I don't think there was a schism so much as a hijacking that hasn't been addressed. The problem is more that the ""feminist"" label has been used to excuse some horrible behaviour, and it hasn't been dealt with.There's a debate to be had in whether that's the fault of feminism at large or the people who use the label to excuse bad behaviour, but it's definitely an extant problem. I'm of the opinion that you can't blame people for things they didn't do, and so I'm reluctant to buy the idea that all feminists are responsible for the behaviour of shitty people who share the label in the same way that I'm reluctant to buy the idea that all men are responsible for the behaviour or rapists. It's not logical. Nobody controls anyone but themselves. The problem for me is that people are willing to hijack social movements that are supposed to be for good to excuse bad behaviour, and that goes for both sides, but it's allowed to happen when it's convenient for the movement in question. Thats not unique to feminism. Every political movement does it. Edit: Now I'm just hearing news that some scumbag shot up a synagogue over the weekend. Case in point: this is not a problem that is unique to feminism, and holy shit, you don't see feminists, even the extreme ones, shooting up innocent people. Feminists can be damned irritating sometimes when the extremists and SJWs pick bullshit fights over non-issues, but God damn, even the extremists among SJWs aren't actively massacring innocent people. I'll take annoying, ill informed ""holier than thou"" assholes any day over shitheads who go out and massacre innocent people just trying to go about their daily lives any day. Extreme feminists are irritating and illogical, but damn, at least they're non violent for the most part.

"Please read all of this;So you see destroying everything better than changing the things you don't like? Most of the left don't agree with the PC bullshit. Hell Scotland (where I'm from) is a hugely left wing country but PC culture is also largely ridiculous to most of us. Our favourite comedian is Frankie Boyle (a major left winger), a man who, when given a TV show, decided to make it the most offensive thing ever just to push the limits of PC culture.We don't hear some middle class retard bang on about how we need to ALWAYS be PC and think ""Oh that sounds right"" we collectively say ""oh fuck off and grow up"" which is why a LOT of left wingers were pissed off when that guy got charged for making his dog do a Nazi salute but that was an English, law he was charged under.We view offence to words as being the most ridiculous thing ever, probably because we're the butt of a LOT of country's jokes so if we were to get outraged at words we'd be permanently outraged and we're pretty much born angry so we'd be apoplectic at thing is though, right wing sources won't show you that. They'll show you some other dickhead with the minority opinion that PC is absolute, and they'll frame it as ""the left are against free speech"" which is patently ridiculous.I have this conversation a lot with people where they say ""I'm becoming a lot more right wing because..."" and then they go on to list the same things as you, the voice of a retard with a minority opinion who grew up in middle class where everyone was super nice to each other and afraid to say the wrong thing lest they insult the easily insulted dickhead at the end of the street.You need to take a break from right wing sources and go speak to actual left wing people, research policy and understand that, just like when the media tells the left that Nazis are everywhere, right wing media is telling you that your worst fears are also everywhere, when they're to think for yourself, and soon you'll see that by a factor of about 90%, left wingers and right wingers are no different in mentality. We're only separated by media influence that aims to keep us divided so the powerful elite (the rich) can do whatever the fuck they want to us and we'll be so busy fighting each other that we'll let them do let them do it, because the left is the only ones standing up to the elites while the right continue to support absolute corporate freedom that hurts us all.",0

It did not and I'm absolutely pissed about that, but not bringing up the games as an argument, when it was always meant to be a show based on the books is fucking retarded. This has ZERO to do with elitism, snobbery or whatever, those are the facts. I read the the first book both in the English and German then stuck to the German for the rest, because the English is pretty poor, I also talked to people who read the original, and her hair is clearly described as ""the colour of fresh And the fact that the show is being made because of the popularity of the games doesn't change anything. They clearly said they were gonna base it off of the books and not the games, so getting mad that they didn't keep the changes CDPR made is absolute stupidity.

They had two officers there who even though her verbal angered them were handling the situation well. Then one got a little too irritated and threw a punch.

He didn't need to hit her at all it's just excessive force.It's nothing to do with emotions and more to do with acting like a properly trained officer of the law.

For example, you start with ""Rainbow Cult is a satirical office environment based off real-life events."", but then you jump to talking about bosses without establishing the base gameplay to the player, which would be a good context to understand what you write about boss battles. Is it a type of gameplay? Is it more of a pacman style of gameplay? Neither? Is it a last man standing type of game mode? There are 3 bars in the screenshots - are those for HP, some MP type of thing and a special attack counter or something like that? Are the skills on a cooldown, limited use per match? Do you have extra lives, respawn, are there continues? Is the game completely focused on battle or are there office gameplay related interactions you could expect given the initial line ""Rainbow Cult is a satirical office environment based off real-life events.""? Are the characters fleshed out (do you interact or develop their... well, chracter, or are they kinda like Galsias in a Streets of Rage) or simply battle avatars?

"The claim that ""any ideology"" is correct, after all not many people would like to be friends with actual bona fide kleptomaniac narcissistic egoists with a God when you want total agreement even over what the minimal wage should be to the penny/cent, and you see compromise for that as evil, then you're of course become a the personal lines in the sand. For some people it is slavery, or racism, or freedom of speech. Some people even don't mind threats to their own personal safety, as long as they get to be near powerful people.

"Easily the biggest piece of shit writing about games today. Unsurpringly, the article is poorly-written and full of gems like this kind of well-meaning and frequently employed by developers with vocal fanbases—can contribute to the problem. It positions the “passion” that leads to disrespect and even outright abuse as a virtue, which in turn begets subsequent cycles of vitriolic uproar when developers don’t give their core crowds exactly what they demand. If even massive companies like Blizzard laud these fans’ outbursts, after all, they must be justified.Is this what they teach in Gender Studies? Or is this one of those deals where he knows he's making this up, but figures if he says it confidently enough people will believe it? And here's a clue, dipshit: This is justified. People don't want this product, and it's being sold to them as if it's something other than a shallow cash grab. It doesn't matter if a proper Diablo game is still being developed; the problem is that they thought so little of their audience that they thought we'd love this. That's a problem.

"He's not gonna lose actually. He did sign away his rights by the contract, however there's a document in EU, which Poland also signed, that covers remuneration of authors and performers. It's a PDF document, although has no label as such, so if you try to open it with Adobe it should be viewable. So, continuing the argument, if you were to look in the document provided via the link above, pdf page 47 (page 41 in the document layout), you can find this quote:> Other countries, such as Poland, do not expressly state that the best-seller clause islimited to cases where rights have been transferred in exchange for a lump sum. Art44 of the Polish act states that “In the event of a gross discrepancy between theremuneration of the author and the benefits of the acquirer of author's economicrights or the licensee, the author may request that the court should duly increase hisremuneration.’’Which according to Article 44 of the Polish Act, makes a rather solid case for Witcher's orignal writer. Not only will he have a case, he has a very specific article in Polish act that covers his exact situation, so he's likely to win that even. I'm obviously not endorsing what he's done, just stating facts. Edit: As people rightfully point out, it all depends on when the contract was signed, so if it was a long while ago, before the law I've referenced went into effect, then the contract would be valid and law wouldn't be applied retroactively.

If you do that, you are teaching this girl that:1) All men are probably trash. Instead of allowing the daughter to learn how to find a desireable partner, they are shunned and sheltered from all men. 2) It shows the daughter you don’t trust her to make good decisions, that her ability to detect a safe person isn’t valuable. 3) The double standard shows girls that they can’t make their own decisions like their male siblings can. They aren’t able to defend themselves and need a man to protect them.I am all for protecting your child from terrible people.

The basic ideas was: if Jane or Joe Q citizen sees a tabloid reading ""CIA played role in JFK hit"" next to ""Bat boy found in cave,"" they would say to themselves, *both* stories are crazy horseshit. Pretty clever right? Pretty clever indeed. And the term ""conspiracy theorist"" now refers not only to insane people and LARPer's who pretend the earth is flat, but people who question any official government story.

I also understand why Ford would not have pressed charges when she was 16 (or at any time within the statute of limitations). If you understand why any of the women in Hollywood who've come forwards with allegations against Bill Cosby or Harvey Weinstein did not do so earlier, for example, then I think you also understand. These things are difficult to prove (it's a he-said-she-said situation and the courts necessarily and I believe rightfully *must* have a high bar for proof; that's kind of just the nature of the crime and of our justice system), a criminal prosecution is humiliating and lengthy, and punishments even in the ""perfect"" rape case (like that Stanford swimmer) are too often pretty minimal. Imagine being 16 and trying to tell your parents about this and everything that will be said about you in court and behind your back. Imagine all the intimate details of your life that might become public at your school and what your might think or say and believe or condemn. Ford, in her, testimony, said that was terrified to come forward but believed that she had a civic duty to do so. She only tried to come forwards after it became apparent that Kavanaugh was one of the final picks for the SCOTUS. I also understand that reasoning and how this civic duty changed the balance of her decision to speak up.I get most of my news from NPR and the Journal and I linked some relevant articles/pieces that answer most of your questions, but I'll answer them anyway. Hamstrung compared to [the investigation that never A supplemental investigation is already a deviation. The transcripts of the six interviews would have been passed off exclusively to the Senate in their report, which was not released to the public. Yes, of course that is within their power. The third accuser (and her attorney, Avenati, who is kinda trashy imo, tbh) was omitted, because the WH directed the FBI to only look into the first two allegations. We don't exactly know the WH's instructions to the FBI, but we do know that the WH gave limiting instructions or permitted Senate Republicans to do so and that the resulting investigation only included six interviews. I did listen to the entire testimony, which is far from exceptional. Nearly 20% of American households were tuned in, not including those of us who were streaming it. It's an audience [comparable to that of the Academy",0
"Pretty much. And I kinda have two theories on this. Either the idea that people are inherently good escapes them, which is possible considering the sociopathic tendencies of many SocJus adherents (and therefore they're terrified that exposure to alternative ideas will lead them astray not because the alternative is better, but rather because they already know how weak their position is. They know that for the a large swath of the public, the only reason they align a certain way is due to ignorance of the other side, often due to an one sided media and education system. And those that step outside that line are ridiculed and looked down upon, without being given even a modicum of respect that they might be reasonable in their ideas. Instead, they're portrayed as hateful, irrational, or the reason that's important is that they fear any exposure that isn't inherently telling you ""this person is wrong"" will lead you astray, because their own convictions are weak as well.",0

"I can't tell which country you're in but that isn't procedure in the US. Arresting someone is taking them into custody *on suspicion* of a crime, whether there is evidence of a crime or not. You don't always get charged with a crime when you're arrested, you can be released without charge or 'un-arrested'. This happens commonly for domestic violence accusations. Lots of arrests, maybe some indictments, lots of plea deals. As expected, men are arrested for domestic violence even when the man calls police and is the one bearing comes from a grand jury. Arraignment is a formal charge - that's when the prosecutor is told whether they can pursue the case. The suspect can be ROR'd, bailed or or acquittal comes after the trial.Edit: DA's don't arrest people, the police do. But the commissioner and the DA *do* pressure precincts to follow through with more arrests in a certain area (domestic violence, gang activity, vehicle thefts, drugs) because they are politicians. Arrests prop up the numbers they highlight in their election campaigns.Edit 2: DA's don't oversee a precinct, they are the main prosecutor for an entire county.",0

"Don't go, we need all the good people we can get to keep working on this shit.Let's face it, where SJW's rule, cancer is the imposed order.

I was pointed at r\metacanada a long time ago by a friend, who thought it was merely a shit-posting bullshit Canadian version of the donald, but I quickly found it's one of the few places left you can actually have a free and honest discussion. The Jordan Peterson subs are another great crowd, with enough great folks to far outweigh the inevitable idiots, and the mods are very genuinely tolerant there too.I would actually go so far as to say that reddit has been the very most worthwhile forum site I've participated in so far over decades of internet time. It's not perfect, and many subs are either not as free as they should be or even ruined, but there is still huge opportunity here to have extremely good discussions with people, and the overall format is capable of supporting in depth content in a way that sites like facespam and twatter can't begin to touch. So I say take control, and only make good things of real substance here, reap the rewards of what is worthwhile, and leave behind the trivial and the BS. Fuck r\canacuck, you don't need to deal with idiots and assholes who can't handle even the most factual reality.

Well - listen to it since it's more of a conservative argument against loli is always the Miller case, but there are counterpoints for that argument - it is a big legal gray area in the US (where gab is located), which is why it's still a tough position to defend either way - on principle your default position is that you HAVE to defend it even if it's a grey area, because otherwise you are not being principled in your approach.Free speech is a zero sum game - it's easy to defend what you agree with, but it's hard to defend what you find despicable. Loli hits that moral spot for a lot of people who aren't familiar with otaku culture. Right now a lot of the ""pro free speech"" sentiment aren't just coming from us middle of the road types, but from a lot of traditional conservative evangelical types. Compared to the left, conservatives are VERY sensitive about any depiction of children being harmed whereas the regressive left cares more about WAMEN and minorities being harmed. So the depiction of loli in anime really bugs a lot of normie types, especially the normie conservative folks who are completely unaware of anime or the meme culture that is centered around KiA *has* to follow Reddit's authoritarian rules to exist. The mods think in the long run it's beneficial for this sub to exist as a kind of refuge sub for moderates who got burned by the regressives in the other sub. We're just trying to avoid getting lined up to the wall by a wayward Reddit admin and shot for Gab has touted itself as a strict pro free speech platform since its inception. That was the hill they claimed they will die on, but once again because the founder is conservative, their ideology (feelings) gets in the way of their principles (facts) and he ends up going after his own userbase for it.If he JUST stuck to ""we need to keep the lights on. I don't want to do it either, but we need to be able to survive"" then people MIGHT be more apologetic, but his platform is also at the mercy of all its providers and I bet you a bunch of them will not hesitate to drop them because of how charged and retarded our modern political climate has become.

"This question is just so wrong-headed - how do you define a ""real world concrete change"" - if I told you that feminists reject traditional gender roles, which means they reject the idea that men have to go out and work to earn a living and support their families, if they don't want to - in other words that there's nothing ""un-manly"" about being a stay-at-home husband while the wife is the breadwinner -wouldn't that be a ""real world concrete change"" that would benefit men? I guess you will shoot this down by saying ""Ha! but this change also benefits women! They are allowed to have careers, independent incomes etc"". Which is totally missing the point. This is what is meant by the idea that feminism is about fostering true equality (note: NOT between the sexes. It isn't about making ""real world changes"" designed to specifically lift one sex while holding the other back*. It's about getting away from the idea that it should be an us/them situation in the first place, and getting rid of behaviours that hold BOTH sexes back. *Unless by ""holding back"" you mean movements such as ""#metoo"" are persecuting or limiting men's freedoms by asking them not to sexually harass or abuse women, or passing laws like the ones that criminalised rape within marriage were persecuting men for not letting them rape their wives any more. Here's a Name one feminist inspired ""real world concrete change"" which has NOT benefited men?",0

That's weird.There are so many contradictions, I don't even know where to start.The lack of European only subsidized housing demonstrates systemic racism, because they to can also want to live in a ""culturally appropriate setting"", and your refusal to do so is bigotry.Wanting to live in a segregated tax-payer subsidized Islamic enclave after you immigrate to a multicultural pluralist society isn't culturally appropriate for Canada, so it isn't the right setting to do so. Demanding an apology for allowing someone to speak while you support segregated housing is fucking insane.

"> It is the 41st Millennium. For more than a hundred centuries The Emperor has sat immobile on the Golden Throne of Earth. He is the Master of Mankind by the will of the gods, and master of a million worlds by the might of his inexhaustible armies. He is a rotting carcass writhing invisibly with power from the Dark Age of Technology. He is the Carrion Lord of the Imperium for whom a thousand souls are sacrificed every day, so that he may never truly die.> Yet even in his deathless state, the Emperor continues his eternal vigilance. Mighty battlefleets cross the miasma of the Warp, the only route between distant stars, their way lit by the Astronomican, the psychic manifestation of the Emperor's will. Vast armies give battle in his name on uncounted worlds. Greatest amongst his soldiers are the Adeptus Astartes, the Space Marines, Their comrades in arms are legion: the Imperial Guard and countless planetary defence forces, the ever vigilant Inquisition and the tech-priests of the Adeptus Mechanicus to name only a few. But for all their multitudes, they are barely enough to hold off the ever-present threat from aliens, heretics, mutants - and worse.> To be a man in such times is to be one amongst untold billions. It is to live in the cruelest and most bloody regime imaginable. These are the tales of those times. Forget the power of technology and science, for so much has been forgotten, never to be re-learned. Forget the promise of progress and for **in the grim dark future there is only war**. There is no peace amongst the stars, only an eternity of carnage and slaughter, and the laughter of thirsting gods. That's more than just gritty, because everything is so messed up on a galactic scale. But this also sets the stage for heroism, because without that the Imperium would have already fallen ten times over. There are nihilistic uber-twats as well, of course, but they are few and far between - people are still people, for the most part, trying to do what's right, instead of being motivated by, I don't know, teenage angst, Linkin Park and confusion.",0

Hij die opzettelijk iemands eer of goede naam aanrandt, door telastlegging van een bepaald feit, met het kennelijke doel om daaraan ruchtbaarheid te geven, wordt, als schuldig aan smaad, gestraft met gevangenisstraf van ten hoogste zes maanden of geldboete van de derde categorie. 2. Indien dit geschiedt door middel van geschriften of afbeeldingen, verspreid, openlijk tentoongesteld of aangeslagen, of door geschriften waarvan de inhoud openlijk ten gehore wordt gebracht, wordt de dader, als schuldig aan smaadschrift, gestraft met gevangenisstraf van ten hoogste een jaar of geldboete van de derde categorie. 3. Noch smaad, noch smaadschrift bestaat voor zover de dader heeft gehandeld tot noodzakelijke verdediging, of te goeder trouw heeft kunnen aannemen dat het te last gelegde waar was en dat het algemeen belang de telastlegging eiste.Artikel 266 - eenvoudige belediging1.Elke opzettelijke belediging die niet het karakter van smaad of smaadschrift draagt, hetzij in het openbaar mondeling of bij geschrift of afbeelding, hetzij iemand, in zijn tegenwoordigheid mondeling of door feitelijkheden, hetzij door een toegezonden of aangeboden geschrift of afbeelding, aangedaan, wordt, als eenvoudige belediging, gestraft met gevangenisstraf van ten hoogste drie maanden of geldboete van de tweede categorie.2.Niet als eenvoudige belediging strafbaar zijn gedragingen die ertoe strekken een oordeel te geven over de behartiging van openbare belangen, en die er niet op zijn gericht ook in ander opzicht of zwaarder te grieven dan uit die strekking 267 - belediging ambtenaar, openbaar gezag, hoofd bevriende staatDe in de voorgaande artikelen van deze titel bepaalde gevangenisstraffen kunnen met een derde worden verhoogd, indien de belediging wordt aangedaan aan:1°. het openbaar gezag, een openbaar lichaam of een openbare instelling;2°. een ambtenaar gedurende of ter zake van de rechtmatige uitoefening van zijn bediening;3°. het hoofd of een lid van de regering van een bevriende staat.Zoals u kunt lezen is de eenvoudige belediging als uitzondering geformuleerd op smaad geformuleerd. Wanneer er geen sprake is van smaad, terwijl toch de eer en goede naam van een ander wordt aangerand, is er sprake van eenvoudige belediging. In de tenlastelegging zien we bij belediging van een ambtenaar in functie vaak de volgende omschrijving:hij op of omstreeks [datum] te [plaats], althans in het arrondissement Utrecht, opzettelijk beledigend (een) ambtena(a)r(en), te weten [ambtenaar] en/of [ambtenaar 1] (respectievelijk brigadier en agent van politie Utrecht), gedurende en/of ter zake van de rechtmatige uitoefening van zijn/hun bediening, in diens/dier tegenwoordigheid mondeling heeft toegevoegd de woorden ""Flikkers"", althans woorden van gelijke beledigende aard en/of strekking.",0

Figure 1 presents the estimates for the various types of sexual assault experienced by the women.* Figure 1, is one page 14 of the document and goes into detail about the types of assault the study accounted for and the numbers for those corresponding categories.Now, notice that this study shows the numbers as 28.5% a number higher than 1 in 5, its actually higher than *1 in 4*These women who all responded yes all consider what happened to them as just that, Sexually Assault. I do not think it is a fair to say these women are lying as the study accounted for that and it's really an argument to say that hordes of women are lying about being assaulted for no particular reason or personal gain for a study.Other study's more distant and more recent may show a slight difference in numbers, but 1 in 5 is what all of these continue to suggest.",0

"Many years ago an online friend of mine traveled across the country for Sex Reassignment Surgery. I don't know what the 'rules' are these days ... but she had gone through the entire procedure prior to getting the actual operation. Not the least of which was a lot of therapy and living full time as a woman for a minimum of 12 months.I think it was while we were waiting for her to be taken to theater that we were talking about it, and I asked if she thought the process was too involved. She told me (as best I can recall) that there were times when she felt that it was and was frustrated, but in retrospect that a lot of what was going on was designed to ensure that she was entirely sure about the choice she was making, and as well informed as humanly possible about the the surgery (and after she had recovered from the anesthesia which had knocked her around a bit) she was happy. We lost touch a couple of years later, but she was still happy and I hope she still is to this day. I think, as you note, her being happy was because she had been given realistic we see people like Milo Stewart (a transtrender from youtube, if you weren't aware) who just wander off to an 'informed consent' clinic and start hormones with virtually no real preparation. And we see comments saying ""Your so brave"" and ""U r valid"" (yes ... they generally are that illiterate) and then down the track we see them start posting videos like>My Non-Binary DysphoriaSay sex and KinkWhich starts with the sentence ""Hi! I'm an asexual and I have a lot of gay sex"". Seriously.>Am I still asexual?! What's my sexual gist is ""I no longer identify as asexual"".

Note that the later probably made the task of timely finding alternatives significantly more difficult)Not to claim that entirety of elections hinged on how this shooting was portrayed, but when vast majority of population is led to believe that Republican core supporters are picking up guns to mass murder them, 2 days before they can vote for their that surely had a significant effect on the outcomes.This wasn't just a free-speech debate on the sidelines, but straight up manipulation of elections by major corporations.",0

"What people mean by “rape culture” is that societally we set up barriers for victims of rape (both sexes) to prevent them from reporting it. Or we treat it as a non-crime. When I’m sitting at my job completing my state mandated safety training (everything from using a vpn to secured areas) and one of the topics is legitimately about protecting myself from rapists by watching my alcohol consumption that is rape culture. My job has nothing to do with alcohol consumption or sexual violence. It’s a little tsk tsk to me about my behavior that is none of my employers business and how they believe I should act. Second, I don’t recall any other tips being given out like don’t go walking alone in the middle of the night in the crappy part of town if you don’t want to get murdered. The point is that when it comes to rape, time and time again the onus is put on the victim to avoid rape and not on the perpetrator to not commit rape or to face the consequences for committing rape. A robbery doesn’t happen if a robber isn’t present and willingly committing a crime. A murder isn’t happening if a murderer isn’t present and committing a crime. A rape is t happening unless a rapist is present a committing a crime.We think of things like country music as being fairly sweet, innocent, and encompassing American values. My husband likes this song called Everclear and I fucking hate it. In the song the man sings gleefully about being In love with a particular girl so he slips Everclear in her drink to make her easy. But she passed out so he just left her laying on her front lawn. Everything about that screams rape. He did not have consent in anyway. Singing about and making money off it and saying it’s just a rape culture. It values those things over what real human beings experience every single day. Those are just anecdotes but if you’re going to say there isn’t a rape culture show me how that is possible when we live in a world where we treat each other as commodities.",0

"Same, I just usually say I'm ""not a feminist"" or ""egalitarian"" as opposed to because there are some lolcows on the other end of the spectrum that I'd prefer not to be associated with. I learned a while ago that most labels lead to tribalism and usually some sort of recruitment, etc. that I really just don't want to deal with. > in my case sexuality is more complicated than slapping a label at it and declaring myself thatI feel very much the same way. I usually just say I'm ""gay"" because everyone understands what that means though I feel like gay has a lot of connections to a certain lifestyle (not saying that the lifestyle is inherently bad but that I'm just simply not a part of it). I've actually become more accustomed to saying ""homosexual"" because my sexuality is only defined by my attraction to other men rather than the media I consume, my aesthetic, my politics, etc. I also believe that sexuality is often too complicated to fit into any singular category (because most people are not entirely one thing or another). This is why we have 1,000 sexualities now because people think that every little standard deviation needs its own name when I encourage people to just ""like what you like"" and don't sweat the labels. For all intents and purposes, I tend to identify myself as and luckily those terms are relatively and broad enough that it's rarely met with gatekeeping or accusations of ""you're not a **real** x, y, or z"".

So yeah, women have the breasts they have because it's one of the main traits that attract human males. So they were not really wrong, just expressed it chimps are actually pretty promiscuous (even among human and animal standards), so maybe less so with chimps, which would explain why a chimp's breasts are not as pronounced as a human's when not currently lactating for breast feeding.

"Doesnt matter though. I would say the difference is almost certainly causes by a lack of intent and instead a cry for help. How could the researchers even possibly know that? Indeed the person themselves might not even realize they took the less likely to kill you methodIts quite simple. Men kill themselves a lot more than women, so even if women Do attempt more, first the group that is actually dying should take preference, and second you have to ask if they do attempt more why are men dying at 4x the rate? The answer is because women take less certain suicide methods, but the only logical explanation for that is that it is a cry for help, even if because they know deep down people will help. Indeed there is no other logical explanation other than something as vain as ""women dont want to mess up their bodies"" which is much more ridiculous than suggesting its a cry for help. There is only one logical explanation why women, if they do attempt more than men, only die at a quarter of the rate, and that is because they use it as a cry for help. If they actually had intent then they would choose a more certain methods. Indeed you say these researchers state it isnt due to lack of intent. First where is your evidence for this? Second, lets say that some researchers state that, what is the basis for it? Is it that they asked the woman and She said she intended to? If so thats bullshit, people will lie all the time to make themselves look less stupid, I certainly wouldnt want to be seen as looking for attention (not that that is what a cry for help is, but sadly some people see it that way) if asked so id probably lie too. Indeed even if we concede that they arent lying and believe they wanted to do it, the human psyche works on many levels and we do things we dont even think we in tend a lot.The reason that the while ""women attempt more"" claim is distracting bullshit can be split into the point below. 1. The evidence seems very shakey and is based on sources that vary wildly in their numbers. Furthermore it is ridiculous hard to define what counts as attempted suicide and what doesnt. Does someone slicing part of their forearm with a razor in a non lethal spot count? Someone taking a dose of paracetamol that is absolutely non lethal? Its so vague and undefined its practically useless. In contract someone actually killing themselves is a much more sturdy and verifiable figure2. EVEN IF we are to assume that women attempt more, so what? Men are dying at 4x the rate, whether women attempt more is irrelevant we should absolutely prioritize the group actually fucking dying. Thats what I never got about the while ""women attempt more"" nonsense. Even if it is objectively true it doesnt matter as the group actually dying should be prioritize. Thats like saying ""4x more men died than women in said more"" and someone else saying ""yeah but more women got injured"". As related to above, not only is ""injured"" (just like very vague, but its Also irrelevant, the group actually dying should be There is no other logical explanation that women apparently attempt at twice the rate but men die 4x more (I.e. For every 1 man who does 7 women attempt and only one dies) than woman arent using lethal methods on purpise as a cry for help. Indeed there arent any other logical and there is far more sympathy and support for women than men regarding mental health issue, so that is the logical conclusion. Indeed you say that researchers assert that it is not due to a lack of intent to die. That poses a lot of questions. First why is this the one thing you havent provide sources for? Second what reasons do they give? Third, assuming the first and second question have a valid answer, how in the hell would they know, they arent the person themselves so it is impossible to tell what their actual intent is. Indeed people lie all the time when it comes to the intent of their actions. Not many suicide attempted who did do it as a cry for help are gna say ""yeah I never actually meant to kill myself I just wanted help"". Personally testimony is useless as people lie, especially in cases where it could seriously affect how people view them if they told the truth. Four, lets say that there is some evidence women dont have a less intent to die, and lets also assume none of them are lying if such evidence exists, its still useless because the person themselves mightnt know their intentions at the time. The human psycho works on many levels. Ever had a ""gut feeling""? Thats often your body picling up on subtle hints that you dont consciously process. Sinilarly, even if a woman thought she wanted to die, her body might have picked up that crying for help would provide her the help she needs leading her to picking a less lethal methods. 4. Lets say you somehow met the above 3 points. What is the reason then that it takes 8 women attempting to have the same number of deaths as 1 man attempting? No counter theory and its all use less, and even if you do have one, unless you can satisfy the above Four points, it wont be validThat is the problem. If it takes 8x the woman attempting to have the same numbers of deaths as guys (assuming 2x higher attempt rate in women, and 4x higher actual suicide rate in men) then the only logical conclusion is theyre crying for help. If you want to provide another theory thats fine. But stating state they intent to kill themselves"" with out evidence is useless, even if you have that evidence its Also useless as it is impossible for the researchers to actually understand the intent of another person, even if they do have some kind of evidence to understand their intent (E. G. that is also not very helpful as it would require the replyees to not be free lying about a topic they would likely be lying about, and if we assume they arent lying then that doesnt a count for lack of intent as we cant know what processes might have take place, as many times people do things they wouldnt consciously or didnt consciously understand because they were doing do Indeed I may think Im doing XX for someone to be helpful, when my intent is something completely different based in a past as I say, even if by some niracle we assume that this evidence you havent provide of researchers who, if it does exist, can apparently read minds, and if it is based on statistical data like requires the woman not to be lying AND to not have any actions which make even her unsure of her own actions, even IF we assume you somehow have some magical evidence that fits all the above criteria, AND on top of that, they have a differening theory which logically resolve the great disrepancy between actual suicide attempt to death rate, even IF you have all that (hint:you dont), it doesnt matter. Why? Men are dying at 4x the rate, thats what matters. Those are the figure that that is the most disgusting part about the ""women attempt more"" statistic that gets thrown around. Even IF we are to assume its true and women attempt more and have just as much intent as men, it doesnt change the fact that men are dying that 4x the rate. This is people fucking lives this is the largest killer of men under 35 in the UK and many other countries. Trying to deflect away from that and make it a womans issue by saying ""well women attempt more so women are actually more oppressed by this"" while men are out their dying in droves is the most sickening thing of all. Its not a this is people dying. The way feminists try to use that to try and deflect and down play the fact that men are dying in the masses from suicide and instead try to make it a womans issue, ignoring the fact that in doing so theyll be driving resources away from men and leading to many more deaths, is the most horrific part of all. Even if the extremely suspicious ""fact"" of women attempting more AND having just as much intent is true, throwing that around to make your side seem more oppressed and doing so taking resources and attention away from men who are actually dying, is the most disgusting thing you can do, and purely evidenced why people say feminist is fuck all about equality.",0

She then proceeds to sit on the phone with 911 saying the kid ""grabbed"" her ass, there is no way she mistook his backpack barely grazing her as an ass grab. Also, the kid is 9.

The fact that it begins by deflecting (off-camera) accusations of hatred and ends by shifting any burden to the reader leads me away from that conclusion, not toward it.I don't think ""I'm afraid"" is enough to encompass and own the whole problem. There's still the matter of what you do with your fear. In this case, concluding little more than ""[My critics] should learn why"" externalizes the overreach, it doesn't own it. ""I'm afraid even when I don't need to be sometimes"", or ""I'm afraid but I try not to let it affect my would be sentiments, and would, I expect, garner respect and sympathy. Fear is a beast, but there are still responsible and irresponsible pet owners. As far as the mockery goes, it's definitely a stance worthy of criticism. While I can sympathize with fear, and understand that we can't control what brings visceral terror into our hearts (save for not wallowing in horror stories and frightening ourselves), a person still has to employ their higher faculties to manage the bad actions or prejudiced, faulty thinking that fear might move them to, be that an outright veto or at least recognition and mitigation.

Never mind how Japanese people loved the Scarlett Johansson film or that many in Japan itself still see samurai as heroes and historical symbols, among others. Never mind how the author unwittingly betrays how detached he is from his own country by invoking rhetoric and narratives that are almost a carbon-copy of Western SJWs and academic-activists.EDIT: Adding.&#x200B;",1

">What you have described is very clearly ""not the same people"" which was the standard you decided to create.First, some of them are, and second, the same ""People"" as in a classification of people.>SJWs have been complaining about the gender composition of corporate boards for years now. To the point that California passed a law saying that every board of a publicly traded company in California has to have a woman on it. That's entirely inconsistent with Marxists that would not want those boards to exist.Yes, they pivoted to grievance studies as the next best avenue for attacking Western Civilization aka capitalism. They are useful idiots who would be openly Marxist if it were a viable declaration - and indeed some of them declare it anyways. If the boards are going to exist, they want women on them. And those women should, of course, be feminists. Because feminists will, of course, *operate the boards in a manner antithetical to the boards*. That's the goal.>Trying to make everything Marxism in an attempt to discredit is the same as trying to make everything the alt-right in an attempt to discredit. It's the same as the SJW protocol to avoid actually dealing with positions and arguments and just go ad hominem.There is clear academic lineage connecting Marxism to progressivism.

Best way for that to happen is usually kids growing up with parents who hold such beliefs and taking them as the norm of how things should be.That's the primary way that movements like feminism got so entrenched and wide spread.For obvious reasons, when a man chooses to abstain from starting a family, that man's influence on the next generation becomes next to negligeable. They don't have their own kids to pass on their believes and values to, they don't participate in parent activities and so can't influence other parents who have kids and could also pass on the ideology, they don't tend to care and participate in early education (stuff like PTA) where they could also influence ideology of next I get that on individual bases, making a choice like that is probably highly positive for that specific guy's life - less stress, more money to spend on himself, and it's generally easy to manage one's own life when everything is up you to decide...But in the long term, his beliefs will likely end with him, meanwhile the social trends that him to begin with are pushed by people who do have kids and pass on their beliefs - so will endure and probably only keep the movement looks a bit depressing as it's looking a lot like many men are choosing to step aside from an ideological struggle, rather than putting up a fight for themselves.",0

He behaves as best as he can, but that's like asking a saudi to join my family at dinner and expecting him to follow north american dinner etiquette.

He doesn't understand that these girls at more expert at what they do than he is - which is manipulate lonely men into exchanging money for a some feigned Is it technically extortion?

A coyote might eat a chick, or that chick might get to enjoy life for quite a while.In factory farming, no chick ever has any chance to have a nice life, ever, for any amount of coyotes don't have the option of using rational thought and empathy to recognize the chicks' pain and come up with a humane way to dispatch the chick. Humans DO feel empathy and we DO KNOW how to be humane, but we choose not to. Especially in certain countries. In the US, you can kill a chick or chicken fairly painfully, and with tremendous panic in the bird. In the UK, rules are more humane. This why the UK strictly regulates the gas mixture used to euthanize birds, so that the birds simply pass out without panic (as opposed to using a mixture or a gas that stimulates a panic response).",0

"I am not ""equating"" anything. I am responding to a question that was asked earlier in this comment were discussing whether the problem with SJWs is that their ideas are fundamentally, conceptually bad, or if the problem is that they take good ideas and push them to such extremes they BECOME bad. I contend that the problem is mostly the latter and offered the idea of safe spaces as an example. In principle it's a reasonable idea that we advocate too, even if we don't use the same terminology. We want our spaces, we want the places we've built to adhere to our values, we want escapism from our real life problems, we want someplace where we don't have to deal with feeling attacked as gamers. These are fundamentally reasonable things to want.The problem with SJWs is that they take the idea to an unreasonable extreme. EVERYPLACE they go has to be a safe space, including places like universities that exist to train our minds and confront us with difficult, sometimes uncomfortable ideas. And everyplace they go has to be a safe space for them and ONLY THEM, even if it means coming into other people's safe spaces, demanding it become THEIR safe space, and trying to take over and kick out the existing occupants.That's the problem, not the existence of safe spaces in and of itself.You are absolutely right about the separation principle, we are content to be safe in our safe space, to leave other people alone in theirs, and to suck it up and deal with the rest of the world NOT being a safe space. They aren't, and that's the problem.But you are kneejerk attacking an argument I am not making.",0

Lots of people had known these journalists were just paid and when they coordinated to fabricate a narrative in such a blatantly obvious way it left a sour taste in people's mouths. Then the mainstream media started trying to pull that same bullshit on Trump, and they got stomped.On top of that, the social justice identity politics bullshit had been running wild in other media and hit a big brick wall when they got to video games. Nobody was having their bullshit, and they had no idea how to handle it except to cry and make shit up and fake death threats, so on the other side we just... let them. Because it was stupid, and it was clear to any reasonable person that it was stupid. And it worked. Gamergate found the cure to the social justice identity politics cancer.So while I wouldn't say 5 guys is *the* reason Trump is President, I'd *definitely* say it contributed. Personally, another big factor is the fact that the social justice identity politics crowd is fucking insufferable and when they don't get their way their response is to get even *more* fucking insufferable and try to burn everything to the ground. Honestly, I think they're responsible for making more Trump supporters than any group of actual retards!",0

"Ok well here's some common ground. I don't hear the attacks on the extreme right by the right, similarly I don't think you hear the attacks on the extreme left by the left. Would I be places like twitter and facebook have algorithms that will make sure that left wing people will only see left wing views and right wing people will only see right wing views. Algorithms that go beyond simply what you like but towards what you click on.We see this with youtube, you click on one daft video then suddenly you're bombarded with similar daft videos. It's not an agenda to keep us in echo chambers but rather an agenda to keep us coming back for the content that pleases us.I would doubt that the sane right is in any way a majority but I argue FOR and against and liberalism so I see both sides of the coin so I know that we're all being played. The insane minority has a more vocal voice than the rational majority because the rational majority are just getting on with shit, life, work, bills etc. We have these surface level arguments over everything but when we get down to the nitty gritty, we both know that the powerful elites ( who have no real ideology other than power and money) are the real problems but its easier to fight Joe dickhead with his dickhead comments than it is to fight big business with their wealth and power. Simply accepting that things aren't as black and white as they appear is a massive step towards recognising that me and you, the average right and left winger, can do more together than we'll ever achieve as enemies. Even if, we disagree on the best way to go about things, if we see each other as common citizens we'll find compromise in the middle that will give us both what we want (with without our freedom to each other.",0

"Our punitive system is kinda dumb. When an breaks a rule in order to cut costs, the fine needs to be whatever it costs to clean up the mess, then whatever money they saved by doing things wrong, multiplied by the inverse of the odds of getting caught. Example: wrong disposal of hazardous waste: cost of doing it properly :$100k. Cost to clean it up: $400kOdds of getting caught: 1 in 50Total fine: $400k + 50 * $100kOr perhaps since there are presumably 49 other improper disposals to clean where the propagator want caught, that fee should be multiplied too, becoming 50 * ($400k + $100k)The point is that getting caught breaking the law needs to be MUCH more expensive than following the law and also much more expensive than what you're costing the victim. So if I falsely accuse you of a crime that you would get 10 years for, my false accusation penalty should be at least 5x that, so 50 years minimum. If a company sells customer data illegally, we need to calculate the damage it did to the customers, then add to that how much they got paid to do it or how much they made from the same in other ways, then multiply that by the inverse of the odds they would get caught (thus the more they tried to cover it up, the less likely it would be to get discovered, thus the higher the penalty Once we have those numbers, fining the company that amount would actually be a significant deterrent. If false rape aviation was punished by a year and only caught 10% of the time, on average a false accuser could expect to spend 36 days in jail. Bump that number up to where it ought to be assuming: 10% catch and conviction rate on false accusers, and 15 years for the original rape, gives: 15 years * 10 = 150 years. This might be enough to get the attention of stupid cunts.",1

I was never summoned to the hearing. The entire tribunal was based off of *hearsay*.As such, you are absolutely correct that *some* universities use it to just cover their ass. However, this is not what the college feminists are supposed to be doing. The job of the college feminists is to use this system to destroy and railroad defendants, then funnel the accusers into the feminist racket to pursue further criminal charges against the defendant, using the tribunal's decision as evidence against him, in addition to all of the free resources and legal assistance she will be getting, in addition to the institutional discrimination already within a lot of sex crime training.A lot of universities responded aggressively to the dear colleague letter at the behest of feminists as well as a way to protect their funding. However, it's primary purpose is political. It's secondary purpose is to place feminist activists in key positions where they can also *threaten* the college's funding if they don't get their way by immediately complaining to the feds that the University wasn't abiding by Title IX. the feminist activists became ""keystone"" employees that could have *incredible* power over the rest of the school by threatening funding, removing students who were accused, or ignoring students who's complaints they didn't find valid.The system is built not at the interests of the school, but the interests of politics *in order to force the school to comply*.

I've lived in apartment complexes like that and I've had my car broke into twice, both at night. So let me try to make this as simple as possible for you.

She was right to be suspicious and completely bungled the situation.I also agree that they shouldn't have had to ""cower away"", but again think about the context. This lady is clearly not in a right state of mind. She's obviously it's best to not engage these kinds of people. You have no idea what an intoxicated person might do. She had a large purse, there could have been a firearm in there. Why would you risk escalating the can't just ignore the context of what is happening here and just throw a race card out. Nothing I've described has anything to do with race. The situation could be reversed and I would say the exact same thing. Just stop and think about risk management in the situation. They have very little to gain and a lot to potentially lose. Why take the risk of arguing with the intoxicated lady?",0
"> Consider this, what you call rude are simply necessities for the Chinese to survive with a 1.2 billion population.The Chinese population density isn't higher than Japan or Singapore. In fact, I would say that the more population dense your city is, the more crucial it is to have a deeper understanding of etiquette, which is something the Japanese understand (and New Yorkers could learnHere's a line for black friday in Japan for example, and we both know Chinese would not be able to pull this off: China, its me me me first to elbow through, and I only bring it up since you're upvoted for pretending the Chinese mainlanders have better manners and altruism than which is silly. And in any case, Americans were once considered the worst in that regard, and the most horrible tourists that people dreaded back in the day too, but matured as a people. China will too, but its going to take a few decades and things are getting better thanks to ""Westernization"" as you call it, not worse IMO. 2nd gen have leapfrogged that cultural development by being born into one where they learned better etiquette since birth.And of course I'm making stereotypes, and that's not true for everyone, but I'm responding to a post about Asian-American stereotypes how they are inferior to ""real"" Chinese back home.Regarding racism, most Chinese have never even seen a black guy in person in their life, so they would have no way to form racist prejudices since they have no experience or investment to form a negative stereotype. But a Chinese-American girl that had one too many bad experiences in all-black neighborhoods could be perceived as being racist, but that's just a difference in life experience, not general etiquette and politeness.",0

The Patrice clip seems more relevant as time goes on. The woman who kept on talking about “the nation” speaking is exactly the same type of mentality as the woman saying comedians have to talk about serious topics and that outrage culture that goes along with it.Imagine if a comic tried to dictate to her and say you shouldn’t talk about x and the outrage that would happen over that. Didn’t know about the Apu documentary guy but it’s exactly the same thing. If you have to hold a double standard in a position you take then why should anyone listen? Of course if it’s one rule for you and another rule for everyone else that’s instantly going to mean people dismiss you. It’s just the hypocrisy that I find baffling. The types who say they hate straight white men and then complain about racism and sexism won’t admit they’re a different side of the same coin. People will call out white separatists and then say that safe spaces that exclude white people are fine. They’re either both equally abhorrent or acceptable or you’re a there any comics you’d recommend listening to at the moment?I think if you like O and A you’ll like Cum Town/Nick Mullen. There’s not much of his standup around but just chatting shit on a podcast there aren’t many funnier people I’ve heard. Recommend Kurt Metzger and Million Dollar Extreme too. Metzger did Race Wars podcast with Sherrod Small but I find the guy to listen to. For silly laughs I like Nate Bargatze too.

Starship Troopers is supposed to stimulate your mind not advertise a political order.Imagine how confused you'll be when you find out he had male-centric harems in Stranger in a Strange Land but had marriages with multiple male and female members in other books like The Moon is a Harsh Mistress. Which was his ideal? Probably neither. Not every work of fiction is a politically charged message and that is just fine with me.

I am at place in time where the ignominious behavior displayed by both groups become one in the same. If I wasn’t on mobile at the moment I’d look this up, but there is this political theory (and I apologize if it is cliché or archaic to even mention it) that uses a horseshoe for its The far left and the far right divert not just away from the center, but closer to each other ultimately. I know many people know about this theory, I know it’s not an original or creative talking point, but it is something I wish was more explored. Obviously both sides have their unique flaws and problems, and I’m in no way saying that in events like or the protesting of speakers at Berkeley,, both sides were equal in their virtues and vices. Okay. Almost done. Anyone who made it this far I appreciate for sticking it through lol. Those of the center, right or center, left or center, the libertarians and social democrats who actually understand the true meaning of those ideologies, and the classic “socially liberal, fiscally trope I myself am guilty of using at times lol, I don’t know how, but we need to fucking stand up.

"hell i think the problem now is that people forget you have to reconstruct the from what i understand push tropes and trends to their logical conclusions to show the flaws and thus show a new take and proper criticism of a cliche. you then have to fix those flaws and basically make the trope cool and sensical again. i think it's one reason the MCU is a billion dollar franchise now outside of just being well crafted they actually embrace the weird and wonderful kitchen sink kitchen which is superhero comics that have both magic and superscience, gods and aliens entities and ancient races all coexisting in a somewhat coherent framework. if the original X-men films and the Nolan Batman trilogy made superheroes serious and grounded the MCU made them fun and fantastic :Dan example is how they reconstructed the of colorful costumes where all movie supers had boring black leather for America got his star spangled suit because after being given the serum he got hired as a mascot for the war effort complete with bright and goofy 1940's spandex. and only after he proved himself saving a bunch of soldiers from a hydra prison right after a gig and improvising a better combat suit using props from the show did he come to be respected and therefore make star-spangled spandex look good.and iron-Man is his classic flashy red and yellow because Tony Stark is a flashy egotist who loves fanciness as well as fuctionality and treated his combat suit as a hot rod. we saw him build the suit with ease due to his genious and thus earned our respect to trust his design choices and dude has wicked sense of style :Dand i wanna say the Guardians of the Galaxy reconstructed the classic comic book trope of aliens being a suspiciously similar substitute to human culture by having common cultural trappings like toys and t-shirts present with an alien style. like Star Lord had a grey Tee that had some sort of slogan written in an alien script and Yandu had various little funko type figurines on his dashboard which looked like stylized versions of alien animals. like i spotted a Dunny fig with 3 limbs and 3 ears and a Littlest Pet Shop cat with one eye. so since those little details shown space people can develop similar cultural trends to earth people it made the more pulpy stuff like Maori flavored Gladiator games in Thor Ragnarok all the more more SJW showrunners are too busy showing how racist and sexist everything is they forgot how to make it not that anymore but actual good and interesting XD",0

We were planning on adding a short gameplay trailer so hopefully that will help a bit, but from your perceptions it sounds like we need to tweak the description a bit too.The anti-SJW impression is accurate though, we definitely chose that as the theme on purpose, and it isn't really something that could be changed as a skin - it impacts almost everything in the game, from the level names to the bosses, and especially the cutscenes and voiceovers.

We tried to avoid preachy and lean toward humor as much as possible, though I doubt SJWs will find it funny.We were hoping to show that the problem with SJWs and their preachy walking simulators isn't that they have a theme, it's that they don't have a game. That there's a place in gaming for escapism, **and** a place for referencing the real world too **if** you do it right. Maybe we're wrong about that, but I hope not.",0
This is so retarded it's absurd. He's REALLY reaching with that statement.,1

"IDC what you fantasized about at that age, it's incredibly cringy how you think you developed at a somehow perfect age in a perfect way and that another child is 'fucking retarded' for being different.If you're that unable to empathize with the boy because he's male, imagine the same scenario with a 11 year old girl and a 21 year old man.It's fucking disgusting to prey on children.",0

I wear downvotes as a badge of honour because for some reason I can't help but tell people how awfully wrong they are inside of their own people gets you a couple of downvotes but when you get to some serious negatives then you KNOW you hit a nerve by telling the this is like the 20th account for me.,0
I prefer nudity because cloths can be but thats not the worse. The sound or feeling of things rubbing against lenticular plastic (the ridge plastic that gives thing 3d effects) drives me up the wall. My back tingle just by the thought and its extremely unpleasent.A few other sounds causes the same effect like metal scraping metal.,0
">Errr, that's up to the Senate. The House impeaches, the Senate tries and convicts, or not. That's what I meant. A democratic House means at *least* an impeached Trump. Now that you mention it, I wouldn't be surprised if they *do* try to impeach Kavanaugh. I don't think Trump will get removed, at least, probably. But it will be a fight.>But Trump has a number of ways of replying.I can scarcely imagine how angry Trump probably is behind closed doors. The man is not familiar with politics and is much more used to getting his way as a business man. I'd bet all my... rubles? ... sheckles?... I keep forgetting which conspiracy I'm part of... that Trump wants to absolutely *shit can* as many people as he possibly can. His cabinet is probably telling him it would look bad and unstable to pull a Nixon and fire everybody a la Saturday Night Massacre.",0
"I saw at least one person who legitimately thought that. They saw a picture of her someone posted but didn't know it was from a new animation. They just assumed it was now you're just ignoring the point. I don't care about diversity in overwatch. I'm stating what people on tumblr are complaining about. They're not complaining about trans inclusion that's for sure. Op is the one who brought that up. His one tame response might not even know what overwatch is, his moronic rant was crazier than most sjw shit.I'm saying this whole thread is a joke for people to circlejerk over confirmation bias. All these posts nodding along like the op isn't completely the actual complaints are not just tumblr and have been some very ongoing complaints in the overwatch community in general (outside of reddit). Personally as an artist I do think ""sameface syndrome"" is a valid complaint. It's an flaw for beginners or for a single artist who is self taught, but when a studio with dozens of artists on a single project make their female characters too similar looking (not identical) but have more extreme differences among all the male characters, then there's obviously some bullshit going on with the blizzard execs.",1
That’s how I died with 3 characters in one campaign.,0
"It can certainly be debatable if Disney actually knew the full extent of Gunn's online before signing him to do Guardians of the Galaxy. There's no evidence that they were aware of those specific posts. And certainly if they were, they would have told Gunn to remove those tweets long before it became a media The Mouse is very particular about it's image, after all, and only an arrogant fool could look at those posts and think that such ""jokes"" were a-okay and would not be used against him and Disney. When it did, Disney wasted no time getting rid of him.",0

"No, actually an objectively piss-poor, utterly retarded take made by people trying to cast star wars as extremist religious so much...wrong with almost all of their assertions and none of it makes any god-damn sense. For one, the whole ""You didn't like Jarjar, but you got over it."" is actually and factually just total and utter bullshit. Episode one is so reviled that it even popped up in tons of pop what happened to the fandom: shitting on things via youtube became extremely popular post RLM basically took what was a poorly formed, not very good consensus of ""I don't like Jarjar."" and replaced it with a litany of very good criticisms that slammed Lucas for every single writing decision he's ever made in all of his movies. He carefully and expertly filleted everything about that movie, and he pointed out things that were shit that had ever pointed out before in nerd circles. He managed to do this in a way that didn't really feel like some fat comic book guy screaming at the screen, mostly because he did it in a funny voice, had a character that was an caricature(an obese, old as fuck serial killer) and most of his shit was new content. It wasn't 70 minutes of screaming about Jarjar. A good example would be him pointing out having different stories going on muddles the emotional impact of the entire is true. Nobody had ever pointed that out(despite the fact that it's basically stated in the behind the scenes footage by the film's editor). George Lucas was *so mad* about the Mr. Plinkett reviews that he quit film-making all together. Literally. He didn't name names, but he did say ""people on the internet"" and it's a *very* fair assumption that the TPM review was a huge part of that. He can't take being told certain things and bailed the fuck after Plinkett comes out and transforms the general understanding of criticizing something, instead of bitching about endings, instead of bitching about a specific character, people now wish to ape and take off from RLM's success and start doing it as much as they possibly can. Since SW was sold, there was a big explosion of reviewer channels and there's a lot of people who go out of their way to 'clone' the Plinkett style. Sometimes they just try to be smart and come up with original reasons for Why Something Is Shit, and sometimes they literally use the name music and sound stings. &#x200B;Point is, Plinkett opened the doors for being pissed about something on the internet to be more viable than it has ever been. You can make some serious cash doing it and get a ton of followers. Another issue was timing - and another issue is that when you're loudly and openly political, you can't be taken with a benefit of the doubt. Sure maybe Mace Windu existed because they wanted to have a black dude in the movie, but like, nobody every stated ""That's right, black people can use the force, too!"" Wearing ""The Force Is Female"" shirts makes a dude side-eye everything you're doing, because now it's not ""oh, neat, a girl."" It's, ""Oh, I see, This is the Agenda at work."" When you openly state you have an agenda, only the dumbest of fuckers will assume you're not aggressively pushing it with every statement.",0
"Honestly that's one of the the shittiest things about trying to educate myself or others on this stuff. I firmly support men's rights and identify personally with several common men's issues so I like to engage people about these things. Because of this, I like to have actual facts and figures, sources to point to, etc to bolster arguments but even I question these articles purely out of habit. Because most reputable newspapers don't print any of this stuff it takes a decent amount of effort just to figure out whether something is real or if it's just inflammatory cunts trying to co-opt the movement for their own shit stirring agenda. Also,>It's not so much as unreliable as definitely both. They outright lie with relatively high frequency.",0

"We're definitely already in a industrial scale moral panic pushed by the democrats *hard* onto the media. The fact that GG is indirectly correlated to the Kavanaugh scandal now is only going to make things it will wake normies up though.

It reminds me of when they brought up GamerGate to Linday Shepard.",0
