However, it has scaled with our tech and population so of course their methods will become deadlier. And I'm sure Protasents made the same argument back then.""I swear, those Catholics all the time! Ruling over France and Germany with an iron fist, hanging Protasants in this civilized time.""Also, are you implying that the victims of Muslim extremists are innocent whilst Catholics hanging Protasants is justified?Finally, of course extremism will end when Sharia law is fulfilled.

"It's interesting how you have to manufacture a victory for your arguments. Simply stating, ""This is over, I won."" doesn't make it the truth. Let me spell it out for you, troglodyte.

The implication, then, is that the Republican and Democratic parties of the 1860s bear NO resemblance to their namesakes today, and in fact have nearly opposite ideologies. So no, YOUR party did not free the slaves. A socially progressive party with the same name from 1860 that looks suspiciously like today's Democratic party did that. So when you said, ""And it were the mainstream democrats that tried to keep slavery, the woman vote down and were the racist ones. I know its hard to accept, but its democrats that always were the bullshit they are now"" you are really showing your idiocy, ignorance, or willing deceitfulness. You yourself said that today's Republicans bear no resemblance to the Republicans of 1860, and the same is true of today's Democrats. You drew a false comparison and then proved it wrong.

"Being gay myself, this is why I've criticized the community's propensity to label every possible preference or presentation, it just confuses everyone and creates stupid and meaningless labels. Of course, this just got me called a bigot. I've been told I'm ""gray-ace homoromantic"" because I'm not huge on sex but I'm only interested in romantic relationships with men. I've been told I'm ""demi-homosexual"" because I don't like doing one night stands and I like sex more for emotional reasons (feeling close to someone, feeling loved and love the feeling of caring for a man) than I do physical reasons. Been told I'm bisexual/sexually fluid because I think some heterosexual erotica is hot. I've been told I'm an ""otter"" because I'm hairy but am too slim to be a ""bear"". Been called a ""stone butch"" because I fall on the more masculine end of the spectrum, prefer to be the dominant partner, and love taking care of my boyfriends. It's just stupid. Date who you like, wear whatever clothes you like, do your hair however you like, have or don't have sex, etc. Stop thinking every little thing needs a label. Also, kind of a side note, I just want to say how interesting it is how many of these people I see say ""not interested in cis straight men"". As far as I know, there's no inherent physical differences between straight, gay, or bisexual cis men, so it's clearly a political thing (trying to undermine cis straight guys), not an actual sexual preference. That's another issue, stop making your sexuality and gender expression a political thing. ",1.0

"So, I take the time to answer your question as thoroughly as I can and you respond by going off on a tangent about how the SCOC didn't do their job correctly?The SCOC case was about whether Khadr's rights were violated. I am no lawyer but I don't think the scope of their job included trying to figure out how Khadr ended up fighting for the enemy as a 15yo. Despite what your (and my) knee-jerk response is, he was a minor at this time. I believe that the SCOC ruling is fair.The debate about whether Khadr was radicalized by his family or not is an entirely separate subject. The debate over whether he should have been considered a child soldier or not is another entirely separate subject. His family ties and history is irrelevant to the SCOC ruling and to the eventual settlement. You can't choose to ignore a person's constitutional rights based on family history or upbringing.Whether you like it or not, Khadr was a minor when all of this happened. I don't know if you have children, but I do, and having raised a few teenagers and am in the process of raising a few more I can fully understand how a child can look and mostly act like a fully-functioning adult yet not have the mind nor ability to fully think as one. This is a fact that a lot of people forget about teenagers. Especially if Khadr's family is as you describe, Khadr may have not had much of a chance to do the right thing due to his upbringing. I know I sure as hell would never have sent my 15 to a war zone to act as a translator. That's probably the biggest WTF in all of this.In a way I rather like that the US immediately tried to find a way to gain access to Khadr's settlement in order to help not only Speer's family, but also Morris, who was wounded. I think it's rather telling how there was no suit mentioned until there was blood in the water, so to speak. Seeking justice would have been filing suit against Khadr and his parents whether there was $10.5M on the table or not; Much like Canada's settlement with Khadr, there was no suit filed until it made financial sense. ""Justice"" isn't this nuanced.I retract my statements about Harper being your guy; Most people here think that Harper was flawless and that Bernier is some kind of political messiah. As I said in my original post in this thread, there are a lot of things to slag Trudeau over, but this $10.5M settlement is not one of them.

"Gaming/Nerd Culture, +2Plus either Official Socjus or Socjus Attack By Media for the +1The article literally argues that *Lovecraft contributed nothing to horror besides themes rooted in racism, misogyny and homophobia*. This is going far beyond merely saying he had unsavory opinions. The argument is that *every single Lovecraftian trope is unavoidably tainted and carries within it Lovecraft's own misogyny/homophobia/racism*. Everything good about Lovecraft, the article argues, is evident in the works of previous authors.The implication is inherently censorious. Not only is Lovecraft to be removed from the canon, but *nothing that feels too Lovecraftian* (in aesthetics or tone) can be permitted.Not only that, Lovecraft is attacked for ""grossly simplifying"" ""mental illness"" but that just shows absolute stupidity about Lovecraft's depiction. Lovecraft wasn't depicting mental illness or ""actual"" insanity. Legally speaking, insanity is a complete break from reality, but in Lovecraft-land *people in mental asylums are closer to reality than the rest of us*. This is an atrocious demand. The analogue would be that, because Tolkein had some unsavory opinions that influenced his writing, the entire genre of fantasy must abolish the use of orcs, elves, dwarves, etc. They're going far beyond merely ""critically discussing"" the work of previous authors.

"I chose the gender option on my PGCE course as I'm a computer science teacher it seemed like an important topic with all that goes on in computing industry and there is a significant gender difference at the GCSE level (girls make up around 20% of the cohort). One of the things i found hardest about this topic was finding any fucking evidence to support any of the claims that were being banded around. So many of the papers i read seemed to consist of them waffling on a lot, citing each other, and not actually producing any sort of data. Some of the data was blatently cherry picked, some didn't even support the claims that the paper was claiming they supported...I found the whole thing a complete waste of my life, i scraped a pass. The thing that pissed me off the most though was talking to one of the others on the course who bashed out his assignment over a weekend, found some vague sources which supported what he was saying for references and got just short of the top mark bracket for it. I'd spent the best part of 6 weeks of my life when i wasn't on placement, reading papers and writing my own. a lot of them are still on my kindle from where i sent copies to it to read on the commute.  In case anyone is curious, my conclusion is that the industry having a slightly higher ratio of females in tech jobs, than the ratio of university graduates, which in turn is slightly higher then the ratio of university applicants, which is compariable to girls taking the lower education levels indicates that there is no discrimination on the basis of gender, at least not at the industry level (individual companies may do, but its not a general trend) and if anything the numbers more indicate the industry making efforts to recruit and retain talented women where it could find them. This was supported by anecdotal evidence from recruitment companies who basically said skill women who could prove it could dictate their salaries and by the study which showed women have a 2 to 1 hiring advantage in stem subjects. I found a single study indicating that at the primary school level, girls and boys have a similar level of interest in technology (i think it was Finnish, which was apparent a mark against me, despite the fact i couldn't find any uk ones). Which by the time they are 14 has deminished to the point where they don't choose computing as an option. Despite the investment of huge amounts of resources, there has been no noticable change to girls taking up the subject. I was unable to find any data indicating at what point they lose it or why girls lose interest in technology, but felt that more research needs to be done on the 11 to 14 year old age bracket to investigate this trend.

"In her defense, there was no reason for her to be slammed to the ground face-first. Just like there would be no reason to slam a dude face-first into the ground in the same circumstances. [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYPzBtNPVJM) is a video from a different perspective showing the head-first body slam. Warning- there's a LOT of whining. I recommend going to 0:30 to see the slam. Yeah, she had hit the cop and obstructing him. So yeah, she should be arrested. No pass on obstructing and resisting just because you've got a vagina and you managed to not be overweight.  Yeah, she was making it hard to put the cuffs on. But cops should be trained to determine how much force it will take to get an objective accomplished, and to then not exceed that. Just because you've got the strength to slam a person's head to the sidewalk does not mean that it is the right thing to deploy when there's not any real danger in the situation (unless she starts clawing at the face). This could happen to your grandpa after he had four too many beers and wouldn't leave at closing time. It's not about gender or pussypasses. It is about having law enforcement that isn't trying to escalate just so they get a chance to relive their high school football or wrestling glory. I've had to fight my (more drunken than I, but not by a lot) brother on a sidewalk in Amsterdam once (note- New Years in Amsterdam is a lot of fun and I highly recommend against it). There are plenty of safe ways to put a person on the ground that don't involve risking damaging their head.American football works by the principle that when you hit an opposing player so hard that he doesn't want to be hit again, he doesn't play as well for a while. We do not need to use this mentality in our policing. We can use it in the courts. But not on the streets. It DOES take more skill on the part of the cops to subdue someone without hurting them. Similarly, it takes more skill to body-slam someone than to just shoot then in the chest 9 times. We don't tolerate cops shooting people who are not an immediate threat. We require them to use something that admittedly exposes them to more risk and requires more skill on their part. Why should other extreme escalations of force (without regard for the subject's safety) be okay? This could be your grandpa. ",1.0

"from the article:>The decision by a seven-judge panel came as an Austrian national identified as E.S. by the court, had held seminars on Islam in 2008 and 2009 for the far-right Freedom Party (FPO) **where she discussed the prophet's marriage to his wife Aisha, a child at the time, and implied that he was a pedophile.**I consider saying someone married a child is already implying pedophilia. Is it true or not?>Stating that the court had found that ""the applicant's statements had been likely to arouse justified indignation in Muslims"" and ""amounted to a generalization without factual basis"", the Strasbourg-based ECtHR said that the woman's comments could not be covered by the freedom of expression.According to wikipedia there's a source that states precisely that. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad%27s_wives#Aisha_bint_Abu_BakrI guess wikipedia must be also breaking the law.>The court said it ""found in particular that the domestic courts comprehensively assessed the wider context of the applicant's statements and **carefully balanced her right to freedom of expression with the right of others to have their religious feelings protected,** and served the legitimate aim of preserving religious peace in Austria.""this is where it hits rock bottom, people can have whatever feelings they want for whatever reasons, you shouldn't be responsible for offending those feelings specially when you're stating something that is sourced.An example I've seen is how Galileo also suffered consequences for saying that the Earth orbited the Sun, that also helped protect people's feelings and preserve religious peace.At this point it's an outrage that such court ruling exists, if people can't criticize a religion or ideology then it should also should be against the law to promote such ideology as well as it might go against people's ""religious feelings"" and ""religious peace"".",1.0

"Cops are trained to be totalitarian... it's literally their job. They want your complete subservience to 'the state'. You are suffering from something called the Just-World Fallacy. That states that good guys all get rewarded and only the bad guys ever get punished. It is incredibly childish and naive to think this way, and your mom did you a great dis-service by teaching you this. Prepare for a life of disappointment and being taken advantage of, kid.Have you been paying no attention to the news at all? Cops are caught being corrupt all the time... entire police departments are caught being corrupt. *You* are the delusional one if you seriously think cops are the good guys. They have this thing called the 'Blue Code of Silence' or the 'Blue Shield' where they feel that they are at war with the entire population, and they have to cover for each other. Not even making this shit up. You've heard of ""one rotten apple ruins the whole barrel""? Well, the police force is a rotten barrel that ruins all the apples. Cops are so corrupt it hurts. Everything from planting drugs to making speed traps to pay for their overtime (yeah, cops get paid a ton of overtime for appearing in traffic court... high incentive for them to abuse their powers and write lots and lots of tickets...) on top of the department getting a ton of funds from them; some small towns make millions of dollars a year on illegal speed traps. Short videos:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vpt8-HcEYy8  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJ14ng8pGgs  Entire departments are in on this, and if you think it stops there, then your mom raised an even bigger moron than I thought.Ever head the saying ""power corrupts, absolute power corrupts absolutely""? Well, due to dumb, dickless, dipshits like you, cops have absolute power, which means they are absolutely corrupt. They shoot innocent, unarmed people in their own homes and don't get in trouble for it. They shoot innocent, unarmed people in broad daylight in public and don't get in trouble for it. They get caught lying or planting evidence and their boss gives them a paid vacation. You have to be an utter moron to still trust the police, with all the evidence we have of them being corrupt. If most cops were not corrupt, don't you think they would have squashed all the corrupt ones by now? A little logic would tell you that since corruption is so prevalent, then it must be the case that the majority, or at least a very significantly large minority, of them are corrupt. They accept bribes and knockbacks. They lie and plant evidence, they falsify reports. The tradition of police corruption has been there since the beginning of America, pitting anti-vice vs vice for profit.If you ever manage to leave your mom's basement, you may have an encounter with them one day. You probably will change your mind about them at that point.What do *I* do? I'm a sound technician.

"**Nazi book burnings**The Nazi book burnings were a campaign conducted by the German Student Union (the ""DSt"") to ceremonially burn books in Nazi Germany and Austria in the 1930s. The books targeted for burning were those viewed as being subversive or as representing ideologies opposed to Nazism. These included books written by Jewish, pacifist, religious, classical liberal, anarchist, socialist, and communist authors, among others. The first books burned were those of Karl Marx and Karl Kautsky.***^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&message=Excludeme&subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/pussypassdenied/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot) ^| [^Donate](https://www.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/donate)   ^]^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28",0.0

"I play GTAO and recently just argued this with a friend. If you have a desire to just buy shark cards, then you don't actually have a desire to play the game. Over the past few months, simply logging into the game has netted me millions of GTA bucks. They have double cash promos all the time and they have giveaways all the time that simply hand you money.Now, if you wanted to invest time into the game and actually play it then you should have enough money by the end of doing everything to buy almost everything in the game. All the DLC is end game content. It's like buying an expansion pack with virtual currency. And once you have the CEO expansion with a garage (probably $2mil investment), you can do car heists to make money. This alone makes buying shark cards for someone who doesn't have time anymore super easy. In 15 min, you can quickly make $60,000-$80,000 and more if you collect a set of cars.Shark cards are for two people: people who want to play that don't have time but want a fancy car to run with their friends OR people who think because a new car is out, they must buy it like some completionist autistic gamer.All the things you buy in the game for the necessity to have fun are cheap. If you need the fancy stuff, play the game as intended or spend you money.Back in subject though: Cheating should never get you any time in jail.

This lady could be a vegetable for the rest of her life after the blows that cop delivered to her face and you’re totally fine with it— you even support it. Now, if this was a link to an article saying “woman sentenced to ‘x’ years for assaulting officers” I would be right there with you— it isn’t. Instead, its a cop using an excessive amount of force to apprehend one, singular drunk lady while 5 of his counterparts stand within striking distance of both of them. And you’re all cheerin it on. You all just watched a women get the snot beat out of her because she took some drunken swats at an officer. If this lady posed a legitimate threat, then I would also be with you— she clearly doesn’t. She gets tossed around like a rag doll all throughout the video. You guys keep talking about the “potential” threat she posed, how about we talk about the ACTUAL threat she posed which, according to the vide evidence, was slim to none. The officer got a few scratches. Boo fuckin’ hoo. Here’s a band-aid. It may be legal, but that doesn’t mean its right. The lady engaged in the violence, and the cop was sure to retaliate with thrice the amount of pain and ten times the amount of possible destruction that he could have caused on her and her life. Let me ask you the same question I asked another guy, and please actually respond to this one: what do you do if you see an officer beating your wife/daughter/mother. You don’t know why the officer is there, he just is and, boy, is he rocking your loved one. Do you just stand by and shrug your shoulders? What if he kills your mother/girlfriend/aunt because of too much trauma to her brain? What then? Is he officer still in the right? ",0.0

"Ah. Time for history:After Batista was overthrown there was a serious hunt for everyone who supported him. The fate of those who were reported to have supported Batista was pretty simple:From [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuban_Revolution#Aftermath) >A notable example of revolutionary justice occurred after the capture of Santiago, where Raúl Castro directed the execution of more than seventy Batista POWsUnfortunately, as is often the way during such witchhunts, many people who had done nothing wrong were soon being targeted>Shortly after taking power, Castro also created a revolutionary militia to expand his power base among the former rebels and the supportive population. Castro also created the informant Committees for the Defense of the Revolution (CDRs) in late September 1960. Local CDRs were tasked with keeping ""vigilance against counter-revolutionary activity"", keeping a detailed record of each neighborhood's inhabitants' spending habits, level of contact with foreigners, work and education history, and any ""suspicious"" behavior. Among the increasingly persecuted groups were homosexual men.So, dear Socialist CumStain Author ... people who don't like Socialism (and Socialists) often do so for much more significant reasons than you can even begin to comprehend.",1.0
"From ""Persia or Iran"" by Professor Ehsan Yarshater, published in Iranian Studies, Vol. XXII, No.1, 1989.>The suggestion for the change is said to have come from the Iranian ambassador to Germany, who came under the influence of the Nazis. At the time Germany was in the grip of racial fever and cultivated good relations with nations of ""Aryan"" blood. It is said that some German friends of the ambassador persuaded him that, as with the advent of Reza Shah, Persia had turned a new leaf in its history and had freed itself from the pernicious influences of Britain and Russia, whose interventions in Persian affairs had practically crippled the country under the Qajars, it was only fitting that the country be called by its own name, ""Iran."" This would not only signal a new beginning and bring home to the world the new era in Iranian history, but would also signify the Aryan race of its population, as ""Iran"" is a cognate of ""Aryan"" and derived from it. Now technically Iran has been what they called themselves historically, however I don't think it is a remote coincidence that a new Regime that took over just after the Nazi rise to power would start pressing to have the name Iran said instead of Persia.",0.0

"Clearly, you didn't read the articles I posted.I define SJW propaganda as ideologues who are terrible writers pushing their hard left politics into comics.You called me alt-right, because - in your warped reality - you pretend that I'm asking for a comic book industry that mirrors the Matrix in the Matrix Revolutions; Everyone is a Smith Clone (aka white, straight male). Ask yourself: **Who wants to see that?** For example, Vox Day is trying to capitalize on Comicsgate by creating more right-wing comics, or comics with right wing themes. Personally, I don't want to read his comics; **I don't want right wing comics. I don't want left wing comics.** I don't want to read comics where creators push their politics into it. All I want is what I grew up reading; apolitical, fun stories. By the way, when I say apolitical, I mean I don't want to read characters that are a mouth piece/propaganda for political views and/or shilling. It's even worse when the writing is terrible. There are tons of female characters that I love in comics (i.e. Motoko Kusangi from Ghost in the Shell, Kitty Pryde and Rogue from the X-men, Lois Lane from Superman, Mikasa Ackermann from Attack on Titan, Huntress from Birds of Prey, Raven from Teen Titans). You know why I like these characters? Because they're awesome! The writers who write their stories do a good job, because they're good writers and are qualified. I can relate to some of them, and I enjoy watching them overcome their hardships. Now, as far as race goes, at no point did I say I wanted an all white cast of characters (or creators). Do you think I want Storm (from X-men) to be white? I would be pretty annoyed if they did something that stupid, since her African ancestry has been an important part to her character (If you've read Life Death for example). But here's the double standard; remember when Scarlett Johansson was cast as the Major for the live action Ghost in the Shell? Remember how angry people were, claiming that the Major is Japanese. They were talking about whitewashing! Now, if that's the case, then why does nobody complain when white characters are changed (i.e. Jimmy Olsen in the Supergirl TV series, Perry White in Man of Steel, Mercy Graves in Dawn of Justice, Johnny Storm in the Fantastic Four movie, etc) in the mainstream? Granted, these aren't the comics, but the principle is the same. I'll tell you why this is happening: *First of all, it's a blatant double standard.* Second, the people who do this claim that the race of the characters that they change is unimportant, and yet when the race of characters (who's race was unimportant in their own stories) are played by whites, they call it racist and whitewashing.Worse yet, when ACTUAL fans point out the inconsistencies (because they **actually read/buy the comics**), they are painted as racists by the mainstream media, or as crybabies.So this tells me that the race swapping is a politically motivated move; they claim that ""people of color"" are underrepresented. This is all based on the politically motivated belief that white people are privileged, over-represented, and that minorities are being ""forced out"". In other words, this boils down to the belief that ""whites are bad"", or that ""minorities are being exploited/oppressed"". And the annoying thing about it is that the creators of these comics/shows sometimes go out of their way to vilify anyone who points this out.This is why certain legacy characters at Marvel are being overshadowed by minority counterparts (Miles Morales, Riri Williams, the Asian Hulk guy, the female replacement of Thor and Wolverine, etc). If you actually read the articles I posted, you'd see why these characters were created in the first place. Part of it was to boost sales, but in the long run, these characters have no depth, because what's being sold to us are FEMALE and NON-WHITE characters, not HEROES. Who wants to read characters defined by gender and skin color? That's why the Alt-Right is annoying; nobody enjoys a character who's being sold for what they are. We like characters for WHO they are, not WHAT they are. And before you say I contradicted myself, remember that the race/gender swapping is a one way straight; the creators are doing this only change white/male/straight characters. And to make it worse, they openly insult this demographic for not liking the comics. What better way to sell comics than to insult a huge part of your reader base.Besides, why do you think many fans hate the new Star Wars films? They brought back the original characters, and then killed of Han Solo and Luke Skywalker. WHY? That's stupid!People who grew up with these comics are attached to the legacy characters (Steve Rogers, Tony Stark, Bruce Banner, Peter Parker, etc). They put these characters in the movies, but the idea of making movies based on comics is to sell the comics. So when you buy the comics after seeing the film, and then the characters you watched are overshadowed in the comics by their sjw counterparts, or completely replaced in the comics by them. That's what we call a bait-and-switch. This doesn't even make sense in an economic sense.I don't like Jessica Cruz because she's a coward who - in the beginning - was in a holding pattern of being an insecure coward, with little character development (until Dan Jurgens fixed that when he took over writing Green Lanterns; he actually created character development for the two stars, and made them enjoyable for once). It has nothing to do with her being female or Hispanic. What's happening in the modern comic industry is that minority/female/LGBT characters aren't being treated as equals. They are instead being placed on a pedestal solely for their biological traits. In other words, giving characters special treatment and shoved into the foreground solely because of how they were ""born"". So, equality - if that was what was intended  - isn't even being achieved in this form. The creators being hired to write characters that are the same race, gender, or sexuality as themselves in stupid. Just because you're gay, doesn't mean you can write good gay characters. In fact, it doesn't even mean that you're a good writer at all. Being a good writer should be the sole requirement for writing a character.I could go on forever, but here's my overall point: I don't want a comic book industry/titles that look like Agent Smith's Matrix. I want good writing, good characters that are interesting to read, creators that are qualified as writers/artists, and characters are aren't a political tool/mouthpiece for hard left creators. I just want apolitical (in other words, no propaganda) fun stories, like what I used to read when I was younger. I like super hero comics. I don't like SJWism. I don't like being preached at by hard left liberals (or alt-right people, for that matter).",0.0

"Rule 3 summary, because the auto-moderator mandates it and we do what the auto-moderator says: Star Trek discovery is in a bad place.  Its in the same sort of a place as a highly touted first round draft pick of your favorite sports franchise is after the GM and the Coach who drafted him have gotten fired.  Think Current  Lakers' Head Coach / Dead Man Walking Luke Walton.  The sign-up numbers for CBS all-access are bad.  They went down significantly after STD came out (according to an extrapolation by the video in the OP).  My Comic Book Store Guy is fond of saying this about digital comics.  For over a decade now, everyone in comics has been told that digital is the wave of the future and that paper and ink don't have long to live.  Yet, every single month, the digital outlets call my CBSG and try to convince him to hawk their products.  As my CBSG is fond of saying, if you don't know what the numbers are for digital comic sales (and no one does) that means they're bad, because if they were good, you would never hear the end of it and those sales numbers would be highly publicized.  If you're not hearing CBS talk at great length about exactly how strong CBS all-access growth is, that means the numbers are dismal, because if the numbers were good, they would never stop talking about it.  Now, it appears the first five episodes of STD season 2 went way over budget, because what was screened was received horribly and reshoots were ordered.  Think Justice League, think Solo: A star wars story.  Now, Les Moonves, who was the champion of STD at CBS, and those who are loyal to him on the board, are out.  CBS can cancel STD and Moonves takes the entire blame, and the new board gets to write it off.  The leadership that backed STD being gone removes the Sunk Cost Fallacy for eliminating this piece of trash.  The new Picard series (which I'm not yet sure how I feel about) being fast-tracked provides a replacement possibility.  The shorts were made to be sold to distributors as a way to generate some cash to cover STD's losses.  Netflix has not liked the performance they got from STD season 1, and they are not backing season 2.  They made the shorts, and no one wanted them, much like no one asked for STD in the first place.  Everything about STD rubbed me the wrong way from the very start, I'm glad its on life support and I'm glad it will soon be cancelled.  ",1.0

"> You do realise that the last SC game was years ago and flopped right? At this point I'm surprised they managed to pull off this much with clear lack of budget.The game sold 1.5 million copies in its first year. This might not even be below expectations since SCV was also labeled as a low budget game by most… and they sold CEs, a DLC char and 100s of CAS parts for further revenue.Even if it didn't make Namco any money… I fail to see why I should care?Just because SCV was shit, doesn't mean SCVI is lacking any less.This is the 6th main game, yet it has fewer chars than SCII. It is marketed as a SCI+SCII reboot, yet it lacks several chars from those games. I'd give them a pass on Mimics like Edge Master and Charade, maybe even Rock… but Hwang, Lizardman, Cassandra and Yun not available day 1 for free is just not acceptable. Even with all these included they'd have more than enough cut chars for multiple DLC seasons… before they have to touch the dreaded SCV chars.The games always had alt outfits… this one does not… fucking why?The game has the fewest stages of ANY SC main game… and I personally think most of them are fairly bland floating platforms with a backdrop. I personally think it's even worse than 5 and 5 had at least mass… and it's just nowhere near SCII.> Training mode? Fantastic. A ton of useful information and settings.Fine… what did they improve from 5? Which features are new?From what I have seen it seems to be the same feature set as 5. It still doesn't show basic data like initial, impact and recovery frames, or other props like adv, guard dmg, and meter gain of moves. No Hit Box visualization either. The game also doesn't seem to have a proper command training mode, or Combo Challenges (SCV had something with “Main Moves” and 5 example Combos… )The training mode is passable but inferior to something like VF5, or even DoA5(!!!)> The mechanics are awesome as ever. Probably needs a nerf to RE tho.Yeah… I've heard that for SCV as well ""The Combos do Dmg again”, “JG raises the skill ceiling”, ""no negative GBs""… didn't save the game from being a broken mess in the end… with a balancing patch that made it even worse.I didn't mention mechanics since I only played the game for like 10-12h during the Beta and watched streams for a couple of hours. I personally think all additions and changes are detrimental, but only time will tell.RE is just terrible, the omni guard feature is obnoxious and the fucking QTE minigame is one of the worst ideas I've ever seen in a 3D Fighter.The meter omni GI from SCV was dumb, the meterless version from VI isn't any better though. Advantage seems to depend on Dmg of the GIed attack (and not timing as suggested before release), which I also find stupid, but no one knew for sure… maybe if the game had a better training mode…PGI being gone and with it the ability to GI UBs is a bit of plus, that you can't GI GBs at all… is just lame…TE changes are crap as well… if they switch to directional breaks, they should have gone all the way to VF5FS's system, but that would take effort.Lethal Stuns are just another worthless addition… another slowdown as if there weren't enough already and some of the trigger conditions are just fucking retarded. It's obviously better now with a training mode, but during the beta it was just “why did that just happen?”Overall another regression from the game it reboots… > But ye, not enough fucking hats 0/10I personally don't care about CAS and think it's a waste of budget and disk space… but if you just port the unaltered 6-10year old assets into your new game, there is just no fucking excuse to only port half of them. The only reason they are doing this is so they can resell old assets as DLC it already started and the armor packs will most likely be primarily old stuff.As a SC game VI is either stagnation or regression for the series, as a fighting game it simply lacks features you'd expect from a 2018 release… that starts with current gen models and ends with in-game frame data.I don't know why anyone would want to pay full price for that… but if you do… be my guest.",0.0

"Changing Gears of War from a story about a bunch of tough dudes trying to survive impossible odds against a seemingly unstoppable force of gruesome monster set in the action-horror genre, to a story about a young woman's journey through self-discovery seems pretty evident that it's already affected the first-party studio culture. Also if you watch the panel with Phil Spencer he talks about putting more POCs/marginalized people in managing positions, and starting workshops to bring more diversity to the Xbox division. He's also trying to get more women into managing positions within the company. If it were lip service without action I would agree with you, but the fact that they've already completely overhauled the Xbox avatars to focus more on fringe features (missing arms, missing legs, obese people, non-binary clothing/accessories) and changed Gears 5 to placate feminists seems to indicate they've already drunk the kool-aid.

"It's a very specific case when an author, presumably a weaker party in a negotiation from the point of law, does not understand the actual value of one's creation and signs away one's rights to said creation for pennies. I could see how this is protection from predatory behaviour of companies that purchase the rights, which definitely happens. You have 2 sides to a negotiation - one is a company with millions at its disposal, another one is an author, not particularly rich usually and hence without access to quality lawers. So the rationale is to give the author an opportunity to benefit from one's work in case one has been pressured into selling it away. If you think that companies actually negotiate fairly, you're severy mistaken. They'll use all the tricks to squeeze every penny out of a deal.

But after the unexpectedly wildly successful kickstarter, the project manager asked the backers if they should similarly wildly expand the scope of the project... and most were in favor of it.  So all that money went into a much bigger game than was originally pitched.Finally, their methods of raising funds have also been criticized.  And for me, this is the seediest part of the game.

The fact that 12 people were shot to death tells you that every floor was covered in blood, including from the boot prints of the attackers.I can't help but be *absolutely furious* about people who *at first* said Je Suis, saw some of these pictures, and eventually said, ""It's their fault because they were offensive. They should just stop being so offensive.""If you can rationalize offices covered in blood because they said offensive things, rationalize a truck bomb is nothing.Then came their *guilt tripping* of people mourning for Paris and the victims of the Bataclan attack. ""How dare you! Lebanon had it worse a few weeks ago! What about Black Lives Matter? Did you ever consider that this is France's fault?""I was losing my shit reading the news that year.My point is, there's absolutely *no reason* to believe that the SJWs can't rationalize a terrorist attack inside the US against a government agency like Border Patrol or ICE, when they've already rationalized Charlie Hebdo and Bataclan. When somebody like Anderson Cooper comes out and rationalizes a left-wing terrorist attack on a federal building (a la Timothy McVeigh or Dwight Armstrong), and says: ""The *real* victims here are the victim's of Trump's immigration policy""; the resulting normie blowback will be so angry that it may ravage the political left, and possibly destroy the democratic party, in this country.

It's a bit more nuanced than that. You have to go into the authors views on public and private lives. Skin deep its a pro-military book. Under that is a commentary of Societal responsibility and how important it is. It's for that reason it's still recommended in west point /USMC reading lists.At the time it was criticized cause it featured an all-volunteer military with illegal conscription.

">The premises in the presentation are that censorship by the platform owner is acceptable provided the rules and effects are clear, is politically neutral, and focused on tone, Some moderation exists on every virtual platform that I'm aware of. The point that Insights is making is that you have to identify what your moderation is going to be and effectively communicate it without taking a political bias as a platform. That's entirely reasonable. >They see the platform owners as ""hospitality organizers"". That's just a quote giving context to their primary point, which is: ""People are asking how to behave on your platform, rather than solely how not to"". This means that they are saying that users want to understand what is *supposed* to be their standard of conduct, rather than just what *isn't* their standard of conduct.>For one, I don't see google/twitter/facebook any more a ""hospitality organizer"" than I see my email provider: they provide a service by which I may communicate with others. The standards I use to communicate with friends are vastly different than those I use for business contacts, and I neither expect nor desire those standards to be enforced by the email provider.These are wildly different things in both a digital and legal sense. Your emails are *private* communications. You literally have (under American law) an expectation of privacy which *even the police* are not allowed to violate without proper judicial and legal grounds. Public comments on a public platform to engage in a public conversation are going to be totally different and have completely different moderation. I'm not even convinced it would be *legal* for Goggle to moderate your email.>Secondly, these providers already see themselves as politically neutral and focused on tone, so following those guidelines just gives us more of the same. And of course tone itself isn't politically neutral: see the censoring of the legal term ""illegal aliens"" (though to their credit they appear to have backed off on that decision).The report specifically tells them to be politically neutral as part of being more consistent with their rules because tech companies *haven't been*. Google's failure to learn isn't a problem with the report.>Thirdly, being transparent about why you'e censoring someone doesn't really help the person being censored that much. We know exactly why The Daily Stormer was deplatformed: the GoDaddy CEO woke up one day and said ""I hate these guys and want them off my site"". Transparency helps when the rules are consistent. That's the point. You have to do both, that's why both are recommended. What happened with GoDaddy is an inconsistency of the application of rules, not a lack of transparency. If GoDaddy were to be consistent and transparent, they should have a rule that states: ""GoDaddy reserves the right to remove your domain, without notice, at any time, because the CEO doesn't like you."">Fourthly, what if I don't want these platforms to ""police tone""? Tone policing exists in a social context, whether you like it or not. It's why you can't just run up to someone and start screaming ""FAGGOT!!!!"" in their face, and why American law would probably allow them to hit you to get away from them. *Some* boundary exists for tone. The point that Insights is making is that you should be policing tone *and not content*. SCOTUS does the same thing with the first amendment. It's why the government is not allowed to engage in ""viewpoint discrimination"", but is allowed to arrest you for disorderly conduct if you won't stop screaming.>Fifthly, if there is a problem with ""tone"", why enforce a top-down, one size fits all approach to it?They actually say that users will have shifting desires and demands, and a one-size-all approach doesn't fit.Is fifthly a word?...>When Germany censors things it's to ""make online spaces safer"", but when ""dictatorial leaders"" want to do so it's to ""improve their methods of control"". One is the justification of the German government (which you see everywhere in lots of governments), and the other is just a quote from Soros.>And on the page where they discuss flagging porn (which has regulations around providing access to children) and malware (which has quantifiable harmful effects) they provide a case study of The Daily Stormer (who was engaged in legal if unpopular speech) being taken off the internet, thereby trying to create a (strained) association between the three.The page is about ""active curation"".

"I, for one, will be forever suspicious of the so-called ""Age of Man"" when its proponents through the series form orders that are unabashedly built on greed, deceit, and murder, but I'll at least admit that the stories are purposefully made ambiguous as to let players come up with their own conclusions to what's going on and what factions, if any, are in the right.But that's not to say that I believe Dark Souls is hopeless.  In fact, I'd say that there's something intrinsically hopeful about the series (and the titles) purely from the basic gameplay: players overcoming trials and hardships, vanquishing mighty foes encountered along the way.  As for the story, I'd point to the End of Fire ending of DS3, which I'd call the best closure to the series as a whole, being built on the Fire Keeper's hope that mercy-killing the artificially-prolonged world altogether will eventually give birth to a wholly new one.  It's just foolish to call Dark Souls hopeful by pointing to the Age of Dark, its nature being one of the series' most contentious story elements.Bloodborne is a little more pessimistic in that none of the endings put a stop to the turmoil caused by warring Great Ones and their aspiring human servants, but at least the Yharnam Sunrise ending has you personally escaping from it.> So to sum it up. The guy wants more ""Real life stories about mundane boring people in a pessimistic tone.

So yeah, women have the breasts they have because it's one of the main traits that attract human males. So they were not really wrong, just expressed it oddly.Though chimps are actually pretty promiscuous (even among human and animal standards), so maybe less so with chimps, which would explain why a chimp's breasts are not as pronounced as a human's when not currently lactating for breast feeding.

"> Egalitarians, by and large, do not believe in feminism, because they do not believe we live in a patriarchy, and so do not believe that we need to discriminate against men to achieve equality.What is your definition of patriarchy..?Are you denying that men don’t come forward when they’re raped or abused and don’t come forward with mental health issues because they’ve been told to man up and deal with it? Or that they should have enjoyed it? Are you denying that every time an article is posted about a female teacher raping a male child the comments are filled with anti feminist men saying they wish it were them? Are you denying that women get lesser sentences because they’re attractive? Are you denying that women wearing men’s clothes is a fashion statement, but men wearing women’s clothes is a joke? That some of the worst things you can call a man are slurs for a woman (bitch) or being “womanly” (fag) and the worst thing you can call a woman is slurs for being a woman/womanly (cunt, whore)? Are you denying that men are seen as incompetent humans when it comes to being a parent or cooking or cleaning? Are you denying that women are usually given primary custody regardless of how well the father parents his children? These are all cultural norms of a patriarchal society. Patriarchy, led by men, emphasis on being strong, being a leader, being stoic, and emphasis on women being submissive, weak, codependent, caregivers. All under the guise that this is just the natural order of things and not stereotypes perpetuated by a patriarchal culture. Feminists admit (hence the post) that patriarchy can benefit women in some ways, but we don’t even want the benefits. We just want equality.If egalitarians truly don’t believe in patriarchy then doesn’t that mean they think everything is already equal and society is running the way it naturally should..? Men get to be leaders and taken seriously but they also get higher suicide rates and don’t get their rape cases taken seriously. Or.... do you mean “egalitarian” in the sense that you use the term as an excuse when a woman brings up something in society they don’t like and you bring up a counter problem men face? Do you even care about equality if you think women are just complaining and that men’s problems are the real problems? Feminists (hi👋🏻) openly admit when something is sexist towards men OR women.

And a long procession of women were saying how their loving partner or brother tended to become a selfish, arrogant, insensitive, uncaring asshole while on T.  They would refuse to believe their partner's distress was worth stopping the T for.  So long as they didn't hit her they could not see the problem.

He openly expressed his respect and admiration for the Islamic faith. He used plenty of non-white Freiwilliges. etc. etc. etc. He was much more concerned with the Slavs than the darkies.And shit, these authoritarian cunts sure do get all loud and obnoxious about ""cultural appropriation"" if a white person wants to wear a poncho, enjoys eating sushi, or has dreadlocks; but they don't seem to have a problem culturally appropriating ***MY PEOPLE'S GENOCIDE*** for their own political gain...

That they're furries in this case has about as much to do with their horrible tendencies as gamers have to do with being  alt right nazis.To clarify, It's basically holding the same expectations over their community as sjws hold over gaming or nerd Fandoms.

"Starting off your argument with the irrelevant comment about my typing detriments your argument, as it shows you do not have much of value to say so u would rather talk about my typing. Men are the majority victim of every other violent crime. Yes sometimes we do worry about being kidnapped (men get kidnapped more than women tho u r right about the ass fuck part) and we do worry about getting mugged or killed, however unlike women, men are not constantly parading around telling everyone about our fears in order to get some sort of sympathy or special treatment. The only reason we bring these points up Is when WOMEN  bring up how scary their lives are and we are tired of hearing their whining. I appreciate you bringing up points related to mens issues, however, to get back to your original comment when you said ""brock Turner used a pinecone is a bullshit arguement"", I was merely bringing up laws because she had decided to do so. If she had not talked about how women who rape men are technically not rapists according to law, I would not have brought up the fact that he was not a rapist. And also this is why I asked for her view about brock Turner. If she had ALSO said that he was not a rapist then there would also be no reason to bring it up. However she called him an evil rapist. Though he is evil and should rot in hell, to use her words""according to the laws"" he is not a rapist, which proves that she has put herself in a juxtaposition in terms of her views on the different issues, ultimately proving her bias against men.

"No a pussy pass is something that society as a whole has granted to women for the sole purpose of not requiring them to be held to the same standards as men. Which is why they aren't held to the same standards, regulations, punishments, treatment, laws etc... A woman doesn't need to exclaim the use of a pussy pass because it's already in use on a constant basis.This isn't a sub that blames women for everything. It is a sub however for pointing out when society finally denies a pussy pass by treating a woman the same way men are treated on a constant basis. If the granting of pussy passes to women wasn't so prevalent and noticed than subs like this wouldn't even exist because a story about a woman going to jail for a crime just wouldn't be interesting.There are countless subs however just absolutely dedicated to blaming men for everything and anything. Feminism, offmychest, relationships, TwoXChromosomes, and pretty much any default or formerly default sub will readily showcase this anti-men sentiment and overall hate that men have to face constantly. We get blamed for everything, are considered to be the perpetrator instantly(even when we are the actual victim), are looked at as criminals without actually having done anything wrong, get screwed over by the court system constantly, and otherwise have everything going against us while we get to sit here listening to people talk about all of our ""privilege"" and so is it at all surprising that a sub that allows men to vent about the constant situation that is our society is wanted and needed? Is it somehow wrong to allow men to talk about what they see in society or to complain about it? Why is it that when men do complain suddenly it's something that needs to be dealt with or destroyed?

I apologize if this is a real issue for you and I do not mean to offend you, but you also have to look at the bigger picture here. The world is nuanced, and as long as you continue seeing it in black and white you become just as despicable as the very people who have originally made this such a horrible issue as it is in the first place today. Extremists are extremists - period. It doesn't matter if they're ""far right"" or ""far left"" - no matter what views they hold, the EXTREMISM is the issue, not the values they believe that they hold dear.> In the future, when you find yourself starting to do what you have quite literally become famous for doing - take a step back, breathe a little bit, and come back a little bit more calm. People aren't as evil as you try to make them out to be.> Further thoughts: Honestly I believe that both sides of the issue is nothing more than a dick stroking contest to see who is ""morally superior"" - I'll give you a little hint: no one is!

And also - you attacked someone who is VERY much against extreme religious crap that a lot of people try to pull - and who could've been an ally and an advocate for you on this issue - but instead of trying to see from his perspective, you forced him on the defensive immediately and lost him completely on the issue. When you do that, you're not helping your cause at all - you're pushing people AWAY from it.

Why do you think KIA has an explicit prohibition against ""Dear Diary, today I was banned from r/insertsubhere REEEEEE"" posts?

The point system was proposed by KIA community members as a solution to the problem of KIA mods having arbitrary discretion over how they enforced the rules and not making it clear what is and isn't against the rules.  The mods basically said ""heres a thread, guys, feel free to come up with the best system to fix this problem"" and the point system was just that.The KIA mod team are among the only subreddits in the history of this website who took complaints of moderator transparency and discretion seriously enough to make their rules regarding what is and isn't on topic as explicit and transparent as possible, and host regular feedback and voting threads in response to criticism.  Few other subs anywhere remotely this size have mod teams who give two shits about people getting ""unfairly"" banned.Since as it turns out, for every 1 person with a legitimate point there are 100 trolls with throbbing hateboners who will find literally any reason to complain about anything.

Never been called an MRA for talking about equality on a feminist page > NOW fights against this, often with arguments about how joint custody is merely a tool that men use to abuse their former spouses.They fight against the loopholes that people can use when they’re abusive so they can’t use their children as a way to keep abusing a partner (which actually does happen 😱) focusing on certain circumstances doesn’t mean they don’t want any normal fathers to be in their children’s lives > Katherine Spillar openly said she considers ""domestic violence"" to be a clean-up word for ""wife-beating"". In interview with Cassie Jaye, she openly said ""it's not women beating up men, it's men beating up women"". She’s saying what she sees. The people seeking help are almost always women, and so she made her own commentary about it. I personally wouldn’t say domestic violence just means men beating women, it obviously goes both ways. But I guess since me and her have different opinions that means feminism is bullshit. Meh 🤷🏻‍♀️> Most formulations of legal parental surrender involve surrendering your rights and responsibilities before childbirth. Feminists seem to flip their shit at that idea, as well. Some do. I think if the father makes it clear that he won’t take responsibility before 12 weeks then it should be okay. >That said, single mothers do have the right to have a child and then decide they don't want anything to do with it with no repercussions.Do you mean abortion or adoption..? > Did you even read your source? It says right there that Odeh was convicted of the bombing, and bomb-making materials were found in her home. The only counterpoint is that Odeh herself insists she was innocent. I'm somehow not convinced.Did you read it? It says she was physically and sexually tortured into giving a confession. I’m not diving into the back story of every woman associated with feminism in all of history. I simply believe in equality and feminists are the people who are the most vocal about intersectional injustices. But I guess because some lady may have bombed a place in another country that makes feminism void lol",0.0

Indeed the request for comment is used to curse the corporation and launch crusades that pwn millions of libs but it also is the heart of a rash and otherwise unlimited cravenly unstable tribe of imperfect misfits, so it has a yin and yang nature like all mankind so the request for comment is merely a conduit of journalistic ethics and prescriptive group governance.>  > Clearly a side point of no or little interest to you Stitch but this one 'partisan line' post-2016 election ties to the notion of Bokhari that he is in a hostile space. The excuse for that hostility is expressed as due to him being a partisan or quite clearly as a man not on par with the intellectual and impliedly the 'radical centrism' certainty of his equals on the GamerGate side. Let us leave aside the ininformed masses who are here as window dressing and as an inclusion addition that actually faltered in propositions and resolutions due to an ostensible lack of research and little or no public speaking skill.>  > The underlying theme you propose PSA is that this was a meeting of equals. The imposition of corporate privilege is stripped away from Google, thusly they do seek to vilify a rational expression of the societal construct that belittles, estranges and strips Journalists and YouTubers of the dignity of successive and accumulative knowledge and strips said persons of the means to accrue it through productive competence.>  > Again there is a quick and easy entertaining response regarding Bokhari as an partisan hack, dismiss the case as word salad as a 'dishonest spin' which in your case involves a meme or literally the dismissal of Bokhari case as a 'dishonest spin' as you do. In your case you apply a meme to maximise popular low brow consumption (and profitable clicks) with that motivation I see your nature.>  > PSA, I contend herein you are not sharing in the debate to advance understanding. You are in the debate to apply some salve to the injury to your group identity's pride. Perhaps it is better put as try to put some slave head in your mouth as you chew the cud as to how a journalist is arrogant or deceptive for raising concern about group bias against certain tech-types acceding to elevated places of thought and action in society at large.﻿Putting that all aside, deeply confused by what you mean exactly by ""suckered""? My main point here is that we all should send more emails to the relevant parties, and I have previous information that you used to be reluctant to send emails (Pat Bidol) and were surprised that researchers or journos would respond to randos (Morten Bay). To agree with Bokhari that you should send more emails, while embarrassing given the fact that you did, is nothing wrong. The other main takeaway from my various posts on this topic is that I'm a drama-hungry degenerate and that I know it. I was completely unironically on the edge of my seat for the moment that you faced Bokhari, after his passive-aggressive callout that mysteriously left your name out. There's literally no reason he couldn't have simply tagged you in himself, except to ramp up the drama that extra notch. The shitposting that you read as ""getting suckered"" are primarily me snitching on Bokhari, with username pings, twitter mentions, and finally a YouTube comment. Sorry, but it's not in my nature to leave a boring ""hey, someone's talking shit"" and must instead ramp it up successively until I use excessive and vulgar imagery to convey that same simple message. For those in the audience, the ""excessive"" version is:>I am rock hard imagining Sitch posting this, completely unaware that he's currently at the center of a bubbling controversy with Allum Bokhari. >A smile as wide as his frown is stiched into my face as I imagine an innocent and unaware Sitch posting this as he's torn apart on Twitter https://twitter.com/LibertarianBlue/status/1052640134720618496 and on Reddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/comments/9p1yt0/allum_bokhari_a_few_selfdescribed_centrists_who/ >I am nothing short of euphoric with sadistic, malicious glee as I imagine he realizes that at the same moment he mocked others for 20 minute drama-starting videos, he had inadvertantly started his own pointless internet drama. >In other words, I am radical centrism embodied. >Throw everyone under the bus. Your worst enemy, your friends, your family... and even yourself. A delicious and destructive revelry, where everyone is wrong.I'm quite proud of it from a literary standpoint. Really captures how much of a piece of shit I know I am, gives the reader a visceral ""yikes"" reaction, and yet seductively invites them to join me and watch the shitshow about to unfold. My final point is this: You did get the insight labs point wrong, and it's inconvenient to me that I now have to be more careful about what I say about this shit, because other topics have been more interesting to look into than Googleshit that's already covered by plenty of other people. Nobody's gonna read AoIC or UCIESC papers to me, so I was counting on you to be basically the entire basis of my opinions on googleshit. Now I've gotta do my own due diligence, and it's gonna be a complete waste of  time, because I'm still going to come up with ""[Furthermore, the Breitbart discussion of what this document is and does is simply incorrect.

"> The media portrays Trump to be an idiot at every opportunity they canBy reporting what he says and does? Sure, CNN is biased toward their corporate -- NOT progressive -- agenda and some criticism of Trump is unfounded. But Trump makes himself look like an idiot most of the time. He doesn't understand issues or process or the constitution he swore to protect. Remember when he wanted to take individuals' guns away without due process? Remember when he said tariffs are good because the exporting country pays them, when importers and US consumers actually pay tariffs? Plus, he constantly contradicts himself -- even in the same sentence -- without any help from the media. Trump: > In my plan, (taxes on the rich are) going down, but by the time it's negotiated, they'll go up.He sure knows how to con people, though, which is what he's been doing for decades. Technically Trump lost money on all his scams, because he'd have made more money investing his inheritance in the market. Like everything else about him, Trump's business success is a ruse. So he's not that smart, is he? > The media brainwashes people into getting all riled up about politics so that we hate our neighbour.This is exactly what Trump does when he blames everything on Democrats, no matter how outlandish. Death toll in PR: Democrats. Migrant caravan: Democrats. Mail bombs: Democrats. Legislative gridlock while Republicans hold both houses: Democrats. He sicks his crowds on journalists at every rally, even as one of his followers is sending bombs out. He offers to pay the legal bills for followers who assault protesters. He celebrates a Republican candidate for assaulting a journalist. Trump is the epitome of the us-versus-them mentality. It's never his fault -- always someone else's. Crucially, violence against his opponents is OK, but criticism of him is not. If you say nice things about Trump, then no matter what else you do, you're a good guy. But if you oppose him whatsoever, then you're an enemy. It's not about principle; it's about personal loyalty. That's far closer to how the Nazis operated than anything CNN does.As for economic conditions, real wage growth is virtually nonexistent, but all of the positive trends started under Obama, so the only thing Trump can say is that he hasn't fucked it up yet. Except, his one major economic policy, tariffs, are doing much more to hurt the economy than help. And his only major legislative accomplishment is a massive tax break for the rich that will bankrupt the US just like he's bankrupted so many of his own companies -- including a fucking casino! -- not to mention all the small contractors he never paid. I notice you don't cite the stock market rally, which Trump constantly took credit for, because all the gains from this year were just wiped out, but Trump isn't taking credit for that, is he?Recently, Trump claimed he was going to pass a tax break for middle-income families --  which somehow he forgot in the bill he actually signed -- before yesterday's election. Except congress wasn't sitting again before the election. So, not only is he benefiting the rich and powerful at the expense of the poor and middle class, but either he doesn't know how laws are made or he's betting that his followers don't know either. Even if CNN does lie and manipulate their audience, Trump is doing the exact same or worse. When he calls ANY media criticism of himself ""fake news"" and calls those who report on his lies and misconduct ""enemy of the people,"" he's literally channeling Stalin. And some are lapping it up like warm milk. The only reason Trump's support is as high as it is is because his followers are also living in echo chambers, like Fox News (propaganda arm of the GOP), where any criticism is labeled ""fake"" regardless of merit and lies are repeated ad nauseam. But don't fool yourself, Trump lost the popular vote even with all the Republican gerrymandering, insecure voting machines, and voter suppression. Now, the three swing states he needed to win the electoral college just elected Democratic governors. When the House starts doing its job and investigating Trump's misconduct, things are going to get a lot darker for Trump and Co. ",0.0

Sure that would seem self evident without any further information. But we do have further information, such as the following examples.>it is not so much that the country is flooded directly with Jewish authors, as that Jewish publishers determine just which of our Aryan writers shall achieve print and position. … Taste is insidiously molded along non-Aryan lines—so that, no matter how good the resulting body of literature may be, it is a special, rootless literature which does not represent us.[...]>There is a great and pressing need behind every one of the major planks of Hitlerism—racial-cultural continuity, conservative cultural ideals, & an escape from the absurdities of [the Treaty of] Versailles. The crazy thing is not what Adolf wants, but the way he starts out to get it. I know he’s a clown, but by God, I like the boy![...]The Semitic mind, like the Celtic and Teutonic, seems to possess marked mystical inclinations; and the wealth of underground horror-lore surviving in ghettoes and synagogues must be much more considerable than is generally imagined. … Jewish Folklore has preserved much of the terror and mystery of the past, and when more thoroughly studied is likely to exert considerable influence on weird fiction.As you can see, the factor wasn't skin colour, it was other-ness, the state of being other, which was the result of his pathological xenophobia. And yes that manifested as believing that blacks, being the most different from Anglo Saxon whites, where in fact inferior, but as any one who has studied the man & his works can see that was the result of his pathological xenophobia. and it's a good thing he was, if he wasn't we wouldn't have got any of his stand out work, since his work, which is predicated on the fear of the other, simply would not exist without it. People who just declare that Lovecraft was racist & leave it at that miss the point. His hatred wasn't about skin colour, it was about other-ness, which he described as being inhuman & that's how he describes anyone that wasn't a white anglo saxon of british stock.At least in theory, since he then went on toe marry a Jewish woman.

">Just as important as outright bans on particular viewpoints are control over the mass media, the academia and education system. Censorship works, propaganda works and mandatory viewpoints work. You're a literal proponent of soviet style mass demoralization and predictive programming.   It's proven over and over that going against the fundamental nature of humans like this does not work in the long run and leads to cultural, economic, and genetic drain, never mind for a minute that it is evil in the purest sense as all forms of forced mind control are.This garbage has never produced anything but surface compliance and secret resistance except among the most vulnerable, mentally weak, and gullible portions of the populace.>They do actually. How do you think Europe was Christianized? It was by decree. Peganism and blasphemy was criminalized, and if you were expelled from the Church you lost the protection of the law. I am well aware.  What is your point?  That Christians never rebelled and fractured?  That they stayed the same forever because some pieces of shit converted them on threat of death and discrimination?   You might want to go back and read some more history buddy.  And do you also imply Muslims are righteous and moral when they impose their beliefs by invading other cultures and murdering, raping, and outlawing their beliefs through subversion of the state?   Since when has it ever been moral to follow a policy of ""convert or die""?>Those are symptoms of repression working not being futile. Movements have a much harder time recruiting when they're underground. And maybe at some point the movement you've suppressed will be completely dead. I suppose you think drowning a toothache in ibuprofen and alcohol is a cure as well, and the ""war on drugs"" successfully managed to stop drugs from being used and gun control laws have stopped criminals from getting guns.   This is a preposterous notion that flies in the face of reality.   If this was true then ideologies such as Marxism and Nazism would've been stamped out decades ago.  The only time it would work is by killing off the originator of the idea, and that would only delay it for a time until the circumstances lead to someone else formulating the same state-subversive ideas in response to the actions of the state.  The state itself is constantly producing the seeds that lead to its own demise.   The only way out of that is to dissolve the state.>It's pretty retarded to accept tyranny under the guise of private property. Social media is the most important forum of public discourse today and completely controlled by private actors. At least the government has a constitution to follow. Not an argument.  And since social media receives special protections as a supposedly ""neutral"" platform while clearly violating the precepts of that special status and both google and faceberg are benefactors of government contracts and investment, these companies ALREADY fall under the purview of the US government to regulate.Additionally, there is nothing stopping fools from ceasing to patronize these insufferable centralized platforms and moving to the many alternatives that already exist.   Centralized platforms are a disease and the abuse of their temporary power is also the cure.   They are merrily digging their own graves and  should not be interrupted.",0.0

"I think one of the big things is that feminist types want to see only fantasy that makes them feel good about themselves, while me (and I assume a bunch of others) want to experience stories. Flawed characters who hit close to home may not always make you feel good about yourself, but they make you think, they give you more than just the creator trying to flatter the idealised self you imagined for yourself.     Now many of these people say things like ""so you can believe dragons and not muh female/gay/whatever characters??"", but they don't understand that it's different. We need to connect to the characters and honestly, a lot of the time people connect to others because they understand their pain.     My example is Harry Dresden, because I am a huge fan and know my shit. So. Many feminists hate his character. But here is the thing, I connect t him because I am similar. Sure, he is a man, a wizard and detective, I'm a woman, trainee at a dental lab and generally a pussy when it comes to physical danger. But he makes fun of himself, like me, he has this huge sense of justice, like me, he gets in trouble because he can not just bend the knee and spit on his morals, like me.   The pitfalls of this character are similar to my own problems, just amped up and with magic. I could get him. I do not say you all need to be like him or me. But I can feel a sort of fictional companionship.    Not trying to make it sound like I am some brilliant person, I am not. But when I participate in the stories of Harry Dresden I have to look at myself from an outside perspective and I have to acknowledge our shared flaws. It takes some self-awareness which a lot of the more SJW-inclined people don't do, because it makes them uncomfortable.   So lets just take some women's march gender studies girl, with pink hair, who is vegan and freaks out a lot about random first world things. She will not be content with a character like herself, who would probably not be the biggest female warrior, strongest of them all. She wants the allmighty,, flawless heroine and will take any flaw in her as an insult against herself. ",1.0

"Freelancer was Chris's baby, his magnum opus, his big dream. It was 18 months late on release and that was only because Microsoft removed Chris from production management and put more effective managers in charge. It released with most of its major promised features either scaled down or stripped entirely, not even having proper 6DoF movement which was already standard for both contemporary free body and semi-Newtonian flight models. Plus it was so far over budget Chris had to sell his studio to Microsoft where it was stripped of IP and developer assets then shuttered.This is Chris's MO. Wasteful directionless development that breaks its own successes so often that for every five steps forward it takes four steps back. Rather than creating a base mechanical system and then expanding on it, SC now has a hundred modular expansions but the core it in flux and every time it changes all of those modules need reworking. The dev itself is very good at keeping details from the public, but thanks to Star Marine being sent to a third party we know why it died. SIG provided what they claimed was a near final copy of the game engine, some years into development, and the module was built off that.... But of course the core was nowhere near competed so after doing a ton of work getting it sorted Foundry 42 handed back their version and found it was completely incompatible with the game engine SC had moved into by that time. Then, shortly after, SC moved to an entirely different game engine altogether. So the Star Marine module was entirely rebuilt. - for those of you keeping track at home, that means the module was scratch built three times before partial Alpha release, and needs constant work to keep it functional without adding new features or content even now.Chris is currently on a yearly salary of over $900,000, more than even EA's CEO, he has multiple family members on the payroll for a total of over $3 million.... In perspective his families total salary earnings to date are over $20million according to their tax returns. You could develop a solid AAA-level game for that if you start with a functional engine. Is it any wonder people think there's a personal motivation to sell jpegs? That being said, I personally think it's worse than just a simple scam. I think Chris has started to believe his own bullshit, reinforced by the fan base, and doesn't realise he's a great visionary but a shit-tier manager.Now come at me with all your best down votes you StarTards.

Well because it's true; people just don't want to hear that.When one guy fucks up, women immediately jump on the man-hating wagon.  Every man is suddenly a sleazy bastard, right?  All I'm saying is we should know better than to do the exact same thing.  One bitch shouldn't represent every other woman out there, just as one dick shouldn't represent every man out there.I know some really great girls out there who are NOTHING like this and would be appalled at this.  It's sad because you typically miss them over all the fucking misandrist jeering.  :/Bottom line, everyone deserves respect as a human being, that is, until they pull some shit like this, then it's all off the table.

"Honestly, I believe that Kavanaugh probably did do what she says he did. Especially after more information about the heavy drinking and bar fights came out.Here's the thing. The evidence that was presented (ie: none, just testimonies) over the last few weeks would be nowhere near enough to convict him of anything (even if it was still prosecutable). So why the fuck does anyone think it should bar him from a job on the supreme court? Can we please give him the same presumption of innocence anyone should get until he's actually proven guilty? It may seem unfair to some (for some retarded reason), but I'd personally love for the presumption of innocence to still be a thing the day I'm accused of doing something I didn't do. I'm not saying he did or didn't do it, I'm saying that we presume people innocent for a god damn fucking reason.Now the fact that he lied multiple times in front of the Senate and read a speech that could seriously have been written by a 5th grader was pretty fucking repulsive and for that reason alone the GOP should have ditched him. And why did he lie? To a avoid embarassment. I don't want somebody like that on the highest court in the country.

"> That wasn't a rhetorical questionyes it was. you asked that to highlight the ""absurdity"" of me not comprehending the ""obvious""  rather be actually interested in my opinion on the matter.that is because you ""know"" the answer but are unable to explain it so just expect the implied ""answer"" is enough of an actual answer.like i said i cut my teeth debating creationists, the first kind of ideologues the public became aware of.  same kind of ill-logic same kind of feels over reals same kind of ""my offense means you're bad""  as modern SJWs.I know how to make an argument while you can't even justify your own ideas to yourself.>you're pretty unhinged, maybe its time to go outside...says the guy who talks like a goony beard man and ignores science becasue of feels over reals.if you can insinuate character so i can I you sex offender in waiting.>It's like talking to a schizo, you are literally asking me 'explain how the more you want to do something makes you more likely to do it'yes, specifically the psychological mechanisms behind such a thing.  i mean if it is that obvious and that comprehensive of a thing you would be able to explain it to an idiot like me.but the fact you refuse to elaborate on your ideas and just retort with rhetorical questions tells me you have no idea what you are talking about.literally i seen this behavior with ""right side of history' SJWs and ""the bible says it i believe it"" creationists.  it happens when you have strong emotional conviction with little rational justification mainly due to never thinking about the position seriously.  this results in you ""knowing"" you are right without actually knowing if you are right on the matter.it manifests as rhetorical questions as a combination time staller and virtue signal  since you can keep off from having to explain yourself by just throwing the same question back out again and try to discredit the opponent by not so subtly saying ""hay my opponent doesn't know this obvious thing is obvious look how stupid they are!"".works okay if you are doing a popularity contest and you got charisma but falls flat when you are dealing with merit-based situations.>Do you really think that obsessing over doing something versus not thinking about it doesn't make you more likely to do something?no,no i do not. mainly because from what i understand of psychology ""obsession"" doesnt work that way. obsession usually refers to extreme focus on something to the abandonment of other things and often results in cyclic behavior.  obsessive-compulsive disorder is a prominent example of that as one ends up taking certain obstructive thoughts so seriously they end up forming certain rituals around them, such as checking all the locks in your house 3 times in specific order before you go to bed because one thought about burglars or dangers told you if you weren't that thorough you'd be next.  i think it also has to do with keeping some form of order to reassure yourself that you have control of your life.anyway if severe the sufferer will slowly lose quality of life as they put more and more focus on their obession to the detriment of more important things.  it's why it's called a downward spiral, it's a literal loop that drops  down the rungs with each cycle.what you are thinking about is more drive, which is more innate than deliberate if i make sense.  the drive will make itself known and manifest itself even if the sufferer tries their hardest to ignore it.  that's what it means when someone says they can't help themselves.  a proment example of this is the serial killer triad where if a child seems to have 3 specific traits, a penchant for killing small animals, arson, and bedwetting to be precise, may indicate they may grow up to be a serial killer since almost all known serial killers shared such traits in childhood.   basically saying these acts are in the kid's nature and will guarantee they will remain into adulthood if not get worse. drives are the ones that can escalate behavior to be more severe as new exprience stimulates said drive more than before and the sufferer tries to score that high again.   to go back to serial killers they often graduate from killing animals to killing other people when they accidentally kill someone first.  basically the same innate drive to end the lives of animals gets super stimulated when they take a beating too far or witness the order of events that result in someone dying and they ""feel a rush"" as some describe it which makes them want to kill again so they can get that rush back.  and the fact they are ""serial"" killers because they target specific kinds of people in a linear fashion makes their victims serialized. and said serialization is due to having a drive for said specifc individual ie a type.all lines up with the OP about more porn reducing rape since the trick is to have a potential rapist get their first rush from porn thus remain driven for more porn of a similar type but they wil almost never graduate to physical sex because they almost dont get the chance.bottom line you conflate two distinct phenomena and thus wrongfully attribute different aspects to different factors.  and you ae too stubburn to admit you fucked up on that front.",0.0

So the innocent person in prison will continue to rot away in prison, and their innocent will never be known at all. To whatever degree it even allows.It's not a pretty situation. There's never going to be one. Just as rape victims have to accept that sometimes real rapists will get away with it because of lack of evidence. Rape is the ugliest crime to deal with in the legal system for a reason. It's a mess, and will always be a mess.There's no solution to the mess. We can only do the lesser of the evils when we decide what that is. I was going to say that in a perfect world people would come forward and face the punishment for their crimes, but that's retarded. They wouldn't commit the crime at all in a perfect world. So we can't even get into that situation. People aren't going to willingly come forward and face punishment. We live in a world where people rape, and people lie about rape. We can't ignore that just because you want to punish everybody who does the bad things. Yeah, that would be nice if we could just punish bad people. But we can't, because if there were a punishment. Those bad people who lied about being raped would probably never admit they lied. Since they'd be punished. Stop thinking so black and white. It's ignorant. ",0.0

"> just post it up without thinking and it doesn't matter if it all gets proven to be bullshitThat's modern digital media in general, topped up by the ""Women are wonderful"" effect. It's all about getting clicks and generating ad revenue through click-bait and absurd stories designed to get readers to look at whatever the link takes them to. So story titles that don't tell you anything and require you to look at the article, even if it's the complete opposite of what the title suggests or flat out false, see [Betteridge's law of headlines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betteridge%27s_law_of_headlines) for such an example.Then there are the stories claiming ""firsts"" because of particular sex/genders/races etc when there are numerous examples of the case throughout history, especially in modern media shows.For recent examples see how the media fell over themselves about how Star Trek: Discovery had the first black or first female captain, ignoring Sisko from DS9 and Janeway from Voyager. The story changed various times because people kept pointing out how such claims were wrong. Firstly Michael wasn't the captain, nor was she the first black protagonist, nor female protagonist. Goal posts kept being moved whenever it was shown how wrong the stories were.Ironically such claims erase the previous actions of the characters/actors that came before them, but then again instant gratification is a fairly common thing these days where it's all about *now* and the past isn't really worth bothering about, unless someone finds something about it wrong by modern standards and therefore needs to erase it, because erasing history has always been a good idea.

It's clear that you're more of an emotional than a rational person, that's alright, but can you maybe base a single argument on something i actually said instead of just assuming everything? I never said any of that. You're assuming the cop thinks she's a lethal threat. Again, i'm sorry, but that's another dumb assumption. What is it with you and over the top assumptions? She is a threat, no one said anything about lethal. Ironic how easily you assume things about what i think but you can't assume the cops handled the situation in a proper fashion before the video began. You really have no idea what you're talking about, you're only defending her because she's such a fragile woman. Get over yourself, she abused a cop, this is justified by law and by public opinion. Crowd control is not something done only when crowds get aggressive, it's always done in case crowds get aggressive. It's called preventing a dangerous situation and it shouldn't be that hard to fathom. She was already under arrest, don't you understand that? She RESISTED ARREST. The didn't punch her first, arrested her after. They arrested her, she didn't comply with the arrest so they had to take physical actions. If you don't even know what an arrest is it's hard to talk reason with you. Arrest is verbal. When an officer says you're under arrest, you are arrested. She bothers the cops, is pushed away, she hits the cop, he defends, then she's arrested and then she hits the cop again, resisting arrest. You are one to talk about police violence, look at your own numbers and then look at ours, it's clear to see that lethal force is astronomically less common here than in the USA. Punching someone who punches cops is standard procedure everywhere. Tackling is way more dangerous, cop will be on the floor in a vulnerable position. But you don't understand anything about how police do their job so it's logical your emotions get the best of you. The cops are better than the people they arrested. Those people were being aggressive in bars, the handcuffed the first person without problems, then made sure the woman wasn't a threat anymore either. This woman, like you said, was in the wrong, and the cops were better. Cops should be better, and here they clearly were? The didn't attack anyone unprovoked (woman did) they only retaliated (woman instigated multiple times) and they remained professional and controlled the situation. Your entire argument is based on me saying police are always right, funny thing is i never once said that. You are an emotional person and paint the worst picture of the cops, and me, in your head with all your assumptions. Your argument is based on zero facts. Non-lethal measures against aggressive people resisting arrest within reason is never excessive force. It's amazing how you bend the facts so extremely. Everything you say ""i have told you"" i literally did not say and do not believe. You are arguing against an enemy you made up in your own head. Saying that police can't act until there's been a trial is ridiculous and you know that, don't play dumb. Cops have to act in an instance to take out a threat to ensure the safety of themselves and others, they did the right thing and you can't accept that because she's only a fragile woman (who ATTACKED COPS MULTIPLE TIMES)",0.0

"Jesus christ you type like a seven year old. So, first of all, to say that it's believing that women face things men don't is a fallacy is one of the most laughable things I've ever heard. Both sexes deal with shit the other doesn't have to. Here's a few:• *there is virtually no man on earth that has to worry about a woman pulling up in a van, kidnapping them, then fucking them in the ass before murdering them, women worry about this constantly (and rightfully so).*• *No woman in history has been fucked as hard in divorce court as men are, virtually every time.*• *Biologically, men don't have to deal with the struggles of the female body; women deal with monthly mensuration, childbirth, and menopause.*• *Women don't deal with the stigma of what it is to be strong. No one expects them to be brave and stoic in the face of scary situations the way they do with men.*So, no, dipshit. There is no fallacy here. To say that men and women experience all the same shit is just a dumbshit thing to say. Also, if you're going to point out that men get raped too, realized that the vast majority of male rapes are male on male rapes. Dudes will even rape each other.

They will quintuple down in a way you haven't seen.

The blowback from that will be so angry that the normies actually get really mad and start hurting people. Then and only then will the remaining non-progressive Democratic establishment disown the leftists, and the Dems will have to completely reform into something new. The moral panic of social justice will end before 2022, but not without more than a few dead bodies if the Dems have a marginal win. I think at this point a blue or red wave would actually be better in both cases because a blue wave would put the left-corporatist establishment back in charge, and a red wave would make the democratic establishment re-consider their approach early.Social Justice can not survive long term because it is an ideology that is to tribalistic to maintain its ""intersectional"" coalition of racial and sexual identitarians.

(I live in NY she and him in GA) she bought him a car at 15 and told him he doesn’t need to talk to me any more. I believe the car was part of that. I have not spoken to him in two years. My lawyer suggested that I not fight this until he is 18 because there is no way I can win in the court. The judge will ask my son his opinion as to what he wants. She will come after me for more money  and I still won’t see him. It sucks. Only a few more months until he graduates high school and I don’t have to pay her. If he needs money though or anything he can always come to me. I’ll be there for him. Him and him alone. Sorry for the emotional all over the place ramble this really touched me. ",1.0

"That sentence was a true PPD. Some redditor explained why:>Where do I even begin with your response here. Firstly, even if the video were legit, you'd still be talking about an instance of child sexual assault, where a grown woman physically took a child by the hand and forced them to touch her breasts- an act for which, if she shows enough signs of rehabilitation, she will only serve 10 years and if she fails to show enough signs of rehabilitation will only be behind bars longer than that until she does.>>However, had you been paying closer attention to the video, you would have soon discovered how dodgy it is. Had you then googled the case because things didn't add up, you would have very quickly learned that the video is full of misleading claims by the defence attorney and not only is the crime far worse than as described by her, but that her client is far from the low risk she makes her out to be.>>Firstly, I'd suggest you look at the section of the video at approximately the 0.50 second mark and pay particular attention to the time-stamping. You'll notice that it jumps from from ""4-12-10  03:35:44 PM"" to ""4-12-10  03:39:24 PM"". In short, a full 3 minutes and 40 seconds have been cut from the video; the dialogue around that cut reveals that the summations by the prosecution have been removed from it.>>So what was the uploader trying to hide and what might the defense lawyer have been lying about with the case?>>To quote from an article reporting on the appeal for this case:>>""Thompson said Taylor had lured the victim and his younger brother over to her residence with the promise of being able to play Playstation 3. After watching TV for some time, the boy went to ask Taylor about playing the game system. Taylor, according to Thompson, closed the door to her bedroom, gently pushed the boy down onto the bed and then straddled him.>>Thompson said she then took off her hooded sweatshirt and placed the boy’s hand underneath her bra. Thompson said there was contact of her groin against his against his will, and there was skin-to-skin contact of her forcing his hand upon her breast. She then attempted to remove his clothing. Thompson said Taylor also demanded the boy have sex with her, which is contrary to other claims by the defense that she requested it."" [http://elkodaily.com/news/local/defense-argues-unusual-punishment-in-lewdness-case/article_a32e1d84-e079-11e0-a3ec-001cc4c03286.html]>>Small surprise the kid was badly scarred by it as reported here: "" in this case it was a traumatic event. The child has needed, and continues to receive therapy."" [http://www.kolotv.com/home/headlines/90976314.html]>>Clearly there was far more here than a single count of indecently assaulting a child - in fact this was attempted child rape, which falls under the very extreme end of the lewdness charge [http://www.shouselaw.com/nevada/lewd-minor.html] and if she had succeeded in raping the child, she would have gotten either a 25 year mandatory minimum or life without parole, depending on whether the victim had suffered significant bodily harm [http://www.shouselaw.com/nevada/sexual-assault.html].>>As for this crap about her getting a lesser sentence if she'd killed the child, let's lay that myth to rest right now. There are 14 circumstances in Nevada where where first degree murder charge becomes a capital offense (punishable by lethal injection), known as ""aggravating circumstances"".>>Out of the 14, the circumstances with either automatically apply to this case, or could be argued to apply to this case, are:>>-The victim was less than fourteen years old (automatic regardless of whether the crime still took place had she killed him)>-The defendant raped or attempted to rape the victim (automatic had the crime still taken place)>-The defendant tortured or mutilated the victim (as sexual abuse could be argued to be a form of torture, could be argued to apply if the crime had still taken place)>-The defendant committed the murder to prevent an arrest or to escape custody (could have been argued to have been used to gag the victim, had the crime still taken place)>-The defendant committed the murder in the commission of robbery, first degree arson, burglary, invasion of the home, or first-degree kidnapping AND the defendant deliberately meant to kill or knew that lethal force was being used (if luring a child away under false pretenses and holding them in her bedroom against their will could be classed as abduction, and abduction argued to be equivalent to kidnapping, then it could have been argued to apply to Taylor had she killed him whilst the crime still took place).>>In short, there are 2-5 grounds out of a possible 14 set of ""special circumstances"" where her murdering the child could have justified her getting the needle. As 3 of those circumstances apply specifically to serial murders, terrorism and killing a police officer, you're essentially talking about a scenario where if she had killed the child, it covered roughly half of all the ways in which a murder is deemed heinous enough by the state of Nevada, to warrant executing the murdered. As such, not only is this claim a lie, but it is a blatant lie.>>So what about the plea bargain. The lawyer claims it was never offered, but it turns out that's also a blatant lie.>>To quote from 2 different sources:>>""Woodbury said there were negotiations but Taylor would not plead guilty to anything considered a sex offense.>>Chad Thompson, the prosecutor on the case, said plea deals don’t necessarily have to originate at the district attorney’s office and a plea deal would have been possible if she’d agreed to plead guilty to a sex crime."" [http://elkodaily.com/news/local/article_13eb1e20-5da7-50d7-8188-92ef3d9fc601.html]>>Furthermore the reason for this was: ""Woodbury says Taylor did not want to negotiate a plea deal because she did not want to have to register as a sex offender. Woodbury says Taylor felt her life would be over if she had to register (as a sex offender) so it wouldn't matter what she was convicted of."" [http://www.kolotv.com/home/headlines/90976314.html]>>In short, recidivism was such an issue here that this convicted child rapist was so determined to avoid admitting she had a problem and trying to go under the radar, that she rejected a plea deal which would have gotten her a much lighter sentence. When recidivism is clearly that much of an issue here, how was this case even remotely mishandled?>>Are you still even remotely going to argue that the sentence here was even remotely harsh, unjust or inappropriate, given the actual facts of the case?﻿ ",0.0

"I don't share your positive outlook. However, I do think that the comparison to the evolution of art in the past two centuries is being mimicked by videogames.Right now, we find ourselves in the post-modernist era of gaming, where some people are trying to figure out new ways to approach videogame development and playability, but generally speaking most participants are either cynical actors or snotty elitists that think their shit don't stink. And just like with post-modernist art, we are now seeing the kindling embers of the post post-modernism movement, with games such as Doom, BoTW, Mario Odyssey, RE7, SoulCalibur VI (and a few others), where the cynicism and corporate bullshit is worn-out, and the people involved just want to make games that core audiences have been begging for years, just updated to modern sensibilities and tech specs.I'm sure you're now asking ""But isn't that good? We're getting rid of the trend-following ideologues, right?"", to which I say no, not really. See, post-modernism left a stain in the art world that will likely NEVER go away. Audiences, be them philistines or not, got it into their heads that being an artist means being a snooty cuntbag sniffing their own farts and making up excuses for pointless drivel. Critics, and the elitists in the art world, have also collectively agreed to circle-jerk that notion around. How's things going for post-post modernists? Not well, because even if their work is appreciated, even if it finds an audience, people just think of it as ""Oh right, classic-style art"", and don't give it any further thought, leaving new creators to either become another cog, or fall into obscurity.Can this be solved? Well, the PPM in art is still going, under 30 years of existance, give or take, and only a FEW videogames fall into the equivalent state. But videogames are much more product-driven than Art, so the mediocrity of AAA shlock and the post-modernist douchecannoes flooding the market will still present a colossal challenge to anyone that doesn't have the backing of a major studio. I mean, Return of the Obra Dinn is kinda PPM, but it still doesn't much going for it, and doesn't seem to have much replay value.",1.0

">The project involves studying female engineering professors to ""lend critical insights into the social/technical divide"" that results in fewer women entering science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) programs.STEM field subjects don't appeal to women at a base level, and don't appeal to the vast majority of the general public at that same base level. This is because they require a level of scholastic preparation and understanding that is far above what the average person desires to spend, to the point that people who enjoy them consistently showcase similar symptoms to high-functioning autism. There, I saved you half a mil; the NSF should've sent the check to me.Seriously, the verdict on the 'Women in STEM' argument has been available for years now, and the bottom line is that STEM shit just doesn't appeal to the vast majority of people, including the vast majority of women. It's hours upon hours of memorizing formulas and rote material, constant testing to ensure knowledge retention, and repetition ad infinitum. Yeah, anyone can go into STEM and learn it, but as someone part of it, while I would like to see more of anyone in the club, the journey fucking sucks. If you want more people in STEM, the education methodology needs to be rebuilt from the ground up, starting with Mathematics as it's the ultimate framework for the rest of the group, and then moving on from there. Good luck, however, getting old hats to change what clearly works in favor of appeasing the up-and-comers who tend to be self-centered and lazy.>The study seeks to upend current engineering and computer science programs by educating students and faculty on the ""benefits of diversity and transformations required to foster welcoming environments for women.""Then this is not a study. A study collects and analyzes data, that's it. It isn't designed to push changes on its own; such action is supposed to be for those who wish to interpret the data that way. It's almost like this anthropologist is barely a legitimate professor and has no idea what her job is supposed to be (hint: it's not forcing personal ideologies on others for the sake of being able to give yourself a back-pat).>Due to the prominence and impact of ECS [engineering and computer science], identifying gender inequities in the field and interrupting them will help welcome and retain more talented women from a range of intersectional identitiesThe assumption that all women are talented, because that is what is being implied here, is beyond retarded and speaks to the general societal sentiment that too many people have been coddled into thinking they are worthwhile/matter. This just in: you don't. Nobody matters until they make the personal decision to leave behind some kind of legacy. Such a thing is not a 'given', it's an 'earned', and had these people had parents who pushed them to compete via some means, they would've learned this.>""intersecting vectors of gender.""What an unintentionally hilarious statement. Not only does this just sound ridiculous when you read it, because it's obviously the result of a stupid person using big words to sound intelligent, but anyone who has a decent vocabulary knows that the term 'vector' relates to pathogens and disease transmission, resulting in a statement that rounds down to 'intersecting diseases of gender'.>If anything, at least they aren't giving a lot of money for someone to study microagressions, so... that's an improvement I guess?Perhaps, but the organization is still pissing away over half a million dollary-doos that's going to result in a highly-biased result that is woefully inadequate, confusing to parse, and rushed. What would have been a better expenditure would've been to host some sort of scholarship contest for kids entering into college involving some important-yet-lower-tier research project, where said students would have to produce a finalized report and analysis (properly supervised, of course). That way, you immediately separate the wheat from the chaff and find out not only who wants to go to college for STEM, but you also give young kids an exposure to real academic work to see if they want to actual make a career out of studying and testing. This gives them a chance to test the waters, rather than forcing them to make the decision in the middle of their transition and far more difficult undergraduate course work or, god forbid, at the start of their graduate course work because the college they went to didn't have enough funding to start proper academic research projects for undergrads.Or, shit, just donate it to an up-and-coming school/department, or buy a bunch of supplies and auction them off to programs that need them. Fuck, anything would be better than giving money that belongs to the sciences to a fucking humanities professor that unironically teaches shit like 'Queer Anthropology', as if the ancient human races spent any time coming up with statements like, 'Hmm, I woke up on the left side of the bed today, so I guess I'm a demi-gender pan-deersexual wolf-half-human who has a penis, but that's hidden inside me and manifests itself via a vagina'.",1.0

"I surely believe it's more needed there, but that doesnt mean that there arent quirks left that needs fine tuning in the west. Take the wage gap for instance. First of all, the whole 77% of what a man makes is across jobs, not for the same jobs, so it doesnt necessarily prove that women are treated unfairly. But it does highlight some conservative values that still linger that that limits peoples choices through norms if not by rules. You could perhaps say that reducing the wage gap is a mens issue. Cause why do we have such a gap? We put a lot of expectations on women, but being able to earn a lot is not what we expect, so they might feel more free to pursue their passions even if it doesnt provide as much revenue, and take a workload that suits them better. Men on the other hand are considered more imporant, and are seen as more attractive, if they have money and power. So men put passions and personal well-being aside because we have to make money. Another thing that is important to remember is that we cant expect things to stay the way they are, even here in the west. Right wingers dont want women to have access to abortions or for kids to get sexual education(which makes the girls end up pregnant) and thinks marital rape is okay. And the alt right movement has been growing a lot the last few years and is still growing. Racists and bigots are always at work, and financial interests in politics will always need a social struggle that they can use to trojan in their own politics, so the extremists on both sides will always get funding.  They're pitting them up against each other, trying to create polarized enemies, and in my oppinion you're falling for that tactic.

"Exactly.Its like these people just completely missed half of what these movies showed.In The Little Mermaid, there wouldn't be any story if Ariel DIDN'T disobey her father. Actually that's a common one across many Disney classic cartoons, if the ""Princess"" has a father, they pretty much always disobey them even if they're shown to mean well, in order to make the plot happen. Just the ones off the top of my head: Mulan, Jasmine, Ariel, Briar Rose, hell even older cartoons like Thief and the Cobbler Yum Yum fools her drowsy dope of a father into not executing Tack by breaking her own shoe.Now, the exceptions are those that don't have fathers, like Snow White or Cinderella or Belle (I believe, but then again I've never watched Beauty and the Beast), but then those were pretty much the same cases in their Grimm's Fairy Tale versions, they are unique situations where the woman doesn't have a father figure like the others and the themes and messages being told are different. Even in Snow White, where in the original story version she is the daughter of a King, the King plays literally no role in the plot other than to make Snow White a princess by her birth. But yes, I agree, the best stories tell teach people lessons, subtly and archetypal, not propaganda specifically.

"> ...Don't tell me people here actually support this fuckface?Only necessarily insofar as we support the idea behind freedom of expression, association, etc.In other words, it's a matter of principle, not necessarily a preference for the individual involved.  I can understand people with no principles being confused by this, so I will explain:The principle being, tech and media companies should not be playing gatekeepers of morality, thought police as it were.  The precedent being that not even the government is supposed to do this.Just because it is currently legal(generally speaking) to do so does not mean that it is ethical, as in not oppressive, to do so.  Everything is legal until it isn't.  Slavery used to be legal, for example.If Jones wins, it would be a legal precedent that can potentially protect everyone, *including you.*See also: Businesses that are big enough or virtual monopolies of quasi-necessary nature can have a bit more obligation than your average Ma&Pa brick and mortar store.  This is where other anti-discrimination laws above and beyond the basic constitutional amendments have come into play as arguments were made and justified  to protect the life and liberty of people who were being oppressed.  As in non-governmental employers or housing being liable for discrimination.See:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-discrimination_law#United_States_of_AmericaIt's not even necessarily legal.  Businesses that have a close relation to government can sometimes be liable for 1A breaches under ""state action"" or ""state actor"" connections. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_actorThere's also always civil law, where people can sue for damages.TL;DR It's the principle of the thing, not necessarily loyalty to Jones. Also, there are myriad ways this could potentially be argued to be illegal(that is why courts exist, to make these determinations).  Legality is not limited to only the First Amendment.",0.0

Though I supposed by that logic, these companies can be operating in areas where it's 100% legal and since there aren't any actual federal laws in place, anyone going after them would similarly be out of their jurisdiction, so the best they can do is go after consumers in 100% illegal areas.",0.0

Omitting Price's involvement is lying by omission, something that a completely unknown and totally forgettable outfit like Rhizome shouldn't be doing because it's going to bury you rather than bolster you like you think, Lana.>She explains in the thread that most of these disposable jobs go to young workers who can be paid less, and that there is little chance that most companies will be held accountable for their malpractice.This is not malpractice, this is status quo for the working world.

The whole reason they decide to work together in the first place is their mutual animosity for Peter, plus the symbiote also wanting to return and re-bond with Peter.

Sure, a man named Eddie Brock can bond with an alien symbiote and take the name “Venom”, but when his motivation for doing so and the circumstances behind the event in question are so radically altered, it’s practically not the same character anymore.

"Being able to pick your gender can be perfectly fine if it suits the story and the setting. If you're supposed to be a knight in medieval Europe saving the country, the king or whatever, being a woman really breaks the immersion. She wouldn't be a knight and she likely wouldn't even be able to move in the kind of armor they wore. It's just how things were back then. The same goes for a game where you're storming the Normandy beaches for example, you should not be able to pick your gender in such a game, it'd be completely ridiculous seeing women rushing across Omaha beach or whatever.If it's a setting where it makes no difference I'm obviously fine with it. I've played plenty of games where you couldn't even pick your gender but where you were simply forced to play as a female if you wanted to be a certain class. I played a lot of Diablo II for example, and if you wanted to play as a sorceress you were going to be playing a female character, period. There was no choice for a male sorcerer at all. The amazon was also female only. It's not like men didn't play the sorceress or the amazon. The sorceress was *the* way to kill bosses fast if you wanted to ""MF"" (Magic Find - killing bosses for good loot) so it's probably the most popular class in the entire game even though it's only available as a female character.

Obstruction is something American cops use to force compliance or add additional charges to someone who isn't ""cooperating.""

"No need to throw insults.Regarding patriotism it would have to be defined in a way that don´t enter in conflict with “teamwork and cooperation” or the principles of the enlightenment, and usually isn´t defined that way (neither nationalism). We could enter a deep discussion about the meaning of the word “country” and it´s relationship with culture, and therefore how patriotism would have to be defined to not considering other people in other countries “less of a priority” or how loving your country wouldn´t imply loving other people less, we would also have to question ourselves if an abstract concept (or a physical piece of land or territory) do deserve to be loved as well to agree on the differences between patriotism and nationalism. In any case I much prefer a single culture based on the principles of the enlightenment than different cultures (different countries), of course a single culture isn´t how the world is right now, but I prefer to defend what I think would be good rather than defend an imperfect existing model just because it is under the attack of an even worse model.The problem with trying to associate a movement with many other things that are not part of it and calling anyone who disagree with a few of them “retarded” (some people would acuse you of ableism for that) is that people aren’t going to be convinced by that nor are going to take you seriously for that matter. A big problem with feminism is that is an ideology that convinces people that whoever don’t agree with them completely are deeply morally/ethically flawed, and therefore their ideas and opinions can be discarded without consideration. Your approach is much the same, you also consider yourself as in possession of the truth, the main difference is that you consider anyone who disagrees with you, even if only on a few things on a long list, as mentally impaired (and therefore their opinions can be discarded too).

Dude you fundamentally fail to understand that social issues are so much more intrinsic to identity which has everything to do with what right/left divisions even are. Almost nobody has any principled attachment to economic ideology.

Like I'm in California and it's vast majority left wing. We just voted on a proposition that forces EMT workers at private companies to be constantly on call and have to work through breaks. These bleeding heart retards just fucked over one of the lowest paid people in the medical field because they think it's saving lives. All this is proof of that every fucking ideological basis can easily be manipulated into betraying their economic beliefs if they think it will promote their social utopian belief structure.I don't need to educate your ass into understanding that fascism is inherently right wing regardless of whether or not it has elements of radical economic policy derived from the left.Fuck off.

At the BBC we know full well why Carrie Grace got paid a bit less as China editer than the America and Brussels editers. If you can't see that people are more interested in Trump and Brexit than they are in China, and that as a result those stations are on air 24/7 whereas the Beijing reporter is just once a week on Radio 4, then I'm afraid you're simply deluded. Sir Bruce Forsyth got paid loads more than Tess Dailey on Strictly Come Dancing. Was that gender discrimination? After all, they were doing the same job. Of COURSE it wasn't - Bruce was a legend who'd performed with Bob Hope and Fred Astaire - and no-one could pick Tess Dailey out of a line-up.

"Shale oil's expensive to produce, so they went wild back when the price was over $90/bbl.  Shale oil wells peter out VERY QUICKLY compared to conventional/heavy crude.  Like, in 5-10 years compared to a heavy crude well which should last 20-30.  Meaning you have to keep drilling expensive shale oil wells for very short-term gains, and shale oil's the only reason the US suddenly became a net exporter in the last decade or so.&#x200B;The Saudis know this and American shale oil is the reason they first tried to drive the price up (to punish the US, as it was still a net importer) and then crater the price (to punish them for exporting).  The result is that any upward movement in price benefited American companies more than the Saudis, and any threat to cut production meant that American shale oil could fill the gap at a very nice price.  The side effects of this was the obliteration of Venezuela's oil-based economy and a serious fuck you to Russia's petro industry. &#x200B;The shale oil crash is gonna make parts of the Dakotas look like Alberta after Trudeau sr. was done with us, and if we could get a fucking pipeline built with all these damned envirotards running around we'd be a great position to satisfy American demand instead of having them buy Saudi oil and thus fund further global terrorism.

"It's a shame that argument works for people. If I were raped, I would not be afraid of there being evidence of me lying about it. At worst, I couldn't prove it happened and that's it. So they get ""away"" with it.That's just a reality of rape cases. But it's very, very, very unlikely that you'd ever find yourself actually raped and then have tons of evidence that could prove (at a criminal level) that you made it up entirely, to the point you can be prosecuted.There's a more ""reasonable"", but still not great argument of ""but that will make liars never come forward!"" Meaning, innocent men who have been in prison for years and are only freed after a woman comes clean about having lied about it and feels guilty... would remain in prison for the full sentence. And never have their innocence known (not that it helps that much anyway; your life is still ruined, you can't get that time back and the sentence will still follow you around).There are few exceptions where it's understandable that they lie, there was a woman who was raped by a man as a girl, and that man threatened to kill her and her family if she pinned it on him. I forget the specifics, but she blamed another man (I believe the actual rapist was part of why she accused him). And the innocent man was found guilty. And many, many years later she finally comes clean about the situation. So the innocent man was freed. You can understand why a young girl would lie when her actual rapist is threatening her life. It's still horrible that an innocent man's life was ruined forever. But would she come forward if she would be thrown in prison for lying? Should she be?That's a valid argument to start having. But the whole ""oh well they'll prove you're lying"" as a victim is just a silly argument.I think the most reasonable solution to the problem I mentioned is to basically give a clean slate for any people who have lied and gotten men put in prison. So they can come forward without punishment. But, moving forward, it's actually enforced if you're proven to be lying. Since I do think if women came forward about lying, and they were thrown in prison for it... they wouldn't come forward at all. But we can't just let this continue how it is either. Relying on guilt after sometimes *decades* to finally get some honesty going. There was one guy who was convicted and his mother died while he was locked away. And the woman had lied about it, and when he was freed he was torn up because his mother died thinking that he was a rapist. It's just awful. Nobody said rape cases were simple though. They're the most difficult things to deal with. Which is why it's always full of so many problems.",0.0

"> TL;DR: Stick to 2D, and you won't have any legal issues. In the absolute worst case you'll be hit with an obscenity charge, but even if you are, you can contact the Comic Book Legal Defense Fund and they will defend you for free.This isn't a very sane analysis of those cases. Nothing you've posted doesn't prove it's not illegal. It [clearly is](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/07pdf/06-694.pdf) and [has survived scrutiny](https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/search/search.action?na=&se=&sm=&flr=&ercode=&dateBrowse=&govAuthBrowse=&collection=&historical=false&st=content%3A1466a+appeal&psh=50&sbh=&tfh=&originalSearch=content%3A1466a+appeal&fromState=advSearch&sb=dno&ps=50&sb=re&ps=50)) under several cases. It's just that, similar to piracy and myriad [other stupid laws](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00505UZ4G/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1), you are very unlikely to be prosecuted unless you are already being targeted. The same way you aren't going to get a ticket for not wearing a seat belt unless you are caught doing something else too.However, **and this is the important part**, companies and very public entities don't have the luxury of fading into obscurity the way citizens do, and they already have leverage on them in the form of business licences. If they're big enough they might be able to bribe themselves out of it but they can't exactly afford a public media blitz that they distribute child pornography. That's why you are going to see this stuff being banned on platforms and censored by translation companies, because even if it's likely that the private citizen isn't going to get nabbed for this sort of thing that's not a risk anyone is willing to take with their company and investor's money.*Also you are sorely misrepresenting the ruling in the [Christopher Hadley Case](https://web.archive.org/web/20081019165828/http://www.iasd.uscourts.gov/iasd/opinions.nsf/55fa4cbb8063b06c862568620076059d/20a96a77c04347ed86257480006ae8c5/$FILE/Handley.pdf). What happened in that case was the court re-affirmed that Hadley could be charged under the PROTECT Act of 2003 as long as the material was deemed obscene. That's why he plea bargained after that determination, because he knew full well his material would be deemed obscene and he'd be convicted anyway. Here's a quote from the case that makes it very clear. It's not a separate obscenity charge. It's another provision under the same law which has the same penalty, and you still get put on the sex offender registry as well.>**This conclusion has minimal impact on this case given the almost complete redundancy of the conduct criminalized by subsections 1466A(a)(1) and (b)(1) with that of subsections 1466A(a)(2) and (b)(2). The observable differences between these subsections are (1) subsections 1466A(a)(1) and (b)(1) incorporate the Miller test as essential elements, whereas subsections 1466A(a)(2) and (b)(2) do not; (2) subsections 1466A(a)(2) and (b)(2) include the “appears to be” language in relation to “a minor;” and (3) subsections 1466A(a)(1) and (b)(1) encompass a broader list of sexually explicit conduct.**>... >>The indictment in this case simply charges Defendant with violations of subsections 1466A(a) and (b). There is no reference to whether Defendant is being charged under subsections 1466A(a)(1) or (a)(2), or (b)(1) or (b)(2). The conduct outlined in count one states sufficient facts to allege a violation of § 1466A(a)(1), and the conduct outlined in counts two through four state sufficient facts to allege violations of § 1466A(b)(1). Because subsections 1466A(a)(1) and (b)(1) incorporate the three-prong Miller test for obscenity, these portions of the statute are not overbroad in violation of the Due Process Clause. The conduct alleged in the superseding indictment delineates violations of those constitutional portions of the statute; therefore, Defendant’s argument that the entire superseding indictment must be dismissed based on overbreadth must fail. It also follows in line with the [Whorley case's](http://www.ca4.uscourts.gov/Opinions/Published/064288.P.pdf) finding.>But in making his argument, Whorley ignores the language of § 1466A(a)(1), which prohibits visual depictions of minors only when they are obscene. See 18 U.S.C. § 1466A(a)(1)(B). Ashcroft itself noted that obscenity in any form is not protected by the First Amendment. See Ashcroft, 535 U.S. at 245- 46; see also Miller, 413 U.S. at 24; Kaplan, 413 U.S. at 119. Thus, regardless of whether § 1466A(a)(1) requires an actual minor, it is nonetheless a valid restriction on obscene speech under Miller, not a restriction on non-obscene pornography of the type permitted by Ferber. **We thus find Whorley’s as applied constitutional challenge to § 1466A(a)(1) to be without merit**.",0.0

"Dude. I've had the exact same convo with a friend of mine.  Black guy married a single mom who was also black.  She came from the hood though while he came from a stable and healthy family.  He kept asking me why she would start fights over the stupidest stuff.  Why she would scream and cuss and throw stuff the quieter and more docile he became.  He kept saying ""I mean I would just try to listen to her and understand where she was coming from but it seemed to make her angrier.""  Finally I told him that she understood marriage as a fight because that's all she ever saw growing up.  She felt more secure when they were fighting because that's what was familiar to her.  Finally he left her, their two sons, and his step-son because he couldn't take the abuse anymore.  Now she goes around saying how all men are dogs and how being a single mom is so hard.  Bitch, you drove away a faithful, patient, and humble man because you thought assault was the key to a good marriage.  Psycho.",0.0

"Look , your starting to arguments, but to prove you ME right.1. Yes. If a stupid girl started ""harassing"" a grown ass man by calling him names , ANY NAMES, and she would not stop, and she was in NO WAY apologetic or indicative of stopping, THEN she should not be surprised AT ALL when she gets her ass WOOPED. Why? BECAUSE YOU SHOULDN'T HARASS PEOPLE! Sometimes the ""payment"" for harassing another person is a FOOT IN YOUR ASS!Definition of harasstransitive verb1 a : exhaust, fatigue    I have been harassed with the toil of verse —William Wordsworth b (1) : to annoy persistently    was harassing his younger brother(2) : to create an unpleasant or hostile situation for especially by uninvited and unwelcome verbal or physical conduct    was being harassed by her classmates    claims that the police were unfairly harassing himTHOUGHT N@#$ and HONKEY are ""just words"" They are ""uninvited and unwelcome words (deemed so by their targets)"" Which constituteHARASSMENT!!!Now to answer 2:That's a SUCKERS QUESTION, and I'M NOT A SUCKER.See, I am black, BUT I AM NOT""the Black Ambassador of explaining to white people why black people do stupid shit.""I DON'T KNOW WHY THEY DO THIS SHIT, I JUST GREW UP AROUND IT.I DON'T WORK for the NCAA.I am not Paid by the society of gainful Negroes, or whatever.AND I WORK FOR MONEY.So since I HAVE NEVER received my ""defending or explaining black people"" check in the mail, They SHALL NOT BE DEFENDED OR EXPLAINED.Besides, my fee is ludicrously astronomical.So you'll gets no answer from me, cause It ain'ts my job to explain a race of people actions to you.Now if you paid attention, ALL of MY COMMENTS FOCUS ON HARASSMENT.Regardless of how its done.NOW THE REASON A WORD IS SO IMPORTANT IS THIS.It is CLEAR in BOTH the above example AND YOUR EXAMPLE. That people are harassing others. What did they use to Harass their Target?Something they ""KNEW"" would hurt them or rile them up. THAT'S WHY THE WORD IS IMPORTANT IN THIS CONTEXT.Both girls in both examples could have said ""rutabaga casserole"" with the same intensity and it probably WOULD HAVE WENT NOWHERE.We as a species, use WORDS for their meaning and SINCE THE INTENT FROM BOTH GIRLS WAS TO HARASS their targets.They chose the Right ""Words"" to Achieve their goal - a Harried Target.N@#$ for blacks with the white girlHonkeys for white with the black girl.We communicate with words, like I am to you now.But communication HINGES on us BOTH HAVING THE SAME DEFINITION OF THE WORDS, or there is mis-communication or no communication at all.So, when Either girl in Either scenario CHOSE to HARASS another person, they went for the best weapons in their arsenal, THE WORDS THAT EVERYBODY UNDERSTANDS THEIR MEANING TO BE""You piece of shit, I am above you/or you are worthless by virtue of something out of your control - YOUR COLOR ALONE. and I will ALWAYS be better than you because of your INFERIOR Make.""Now If that ISN'T harassment, I don't know what is.Both girls could have just said ""cherry lemonade"" and people would have just been confused and some people might hand not got punched.So words. Words are important.NOW I GET what you are saying. WHY fight over a word?And I'll say this.It's not the WORD, its the INTENTION BEHIND THE WORDS that makes it harassment, a threat, or not.And in the real world. UNCHECKED HARASSMENT BECOMES A THREAT.A Bully who calls you names and picks on your every day, soon LEVELS UP to ACTUALLY KICKING YOUR ASS AND ROBING YOU.If you let them.People from poorer neighborhoods (like me) know all to well to NOT LET HARASSMENT GO UNCHECKED, or it could cost you YOUR LIFE one day , down the road.And getting to your point.Also, I have learned THAT YOU CANT GO FIGHTING EVERY TIME SOMEBODY CALLS YOU A BAD WORD OR HARASSES YOU.It's the secret to Growing Old. ;)But you have to be the judge for yourself in each situation.And I say again. Do not be surprised if when you harass somebody, you get your ass kicked.Because you're just being a mean evil dickhead piece of shit.Words or not, it's still the Harassment. The Girls ""CHOSE"" the words BECAUSE THEY WOULD HURT. So again, were back to harassment.<3rd mic drop>Hold on, I've got to get to amazon, expect no more mic drops for 2 days.",0.0

"tl;dr is last paragraph.It looks like you're going to work on the ""east side"" which is the Bellevue/Redmond area. If it's a tech job, understand now that tech workplaces are pretty bad in most places when it comes to the social justice set.I lived in Seattle and outlying areas for a really longtime. The city has drastically changed for the worse. It's not yet San Francisco bad, but they're trying. Bellevue/Redmond/Kirkland city government is more corporate oriented, so you'll still see pro-business Republicans in municipal government. They tow the party line on most social issues but it isn't a clusterfuck.All of that said, Western Washington is a really diverse place. Want to live in the woods with rednecks? You can do that. Want to live in a trendy condo? No problem. Want a suburb? Plenty to choose from, and it's all commutable to the east side. For the most part, you can live in the sort of place that suits you and the amenities in the urban core are superb. State government isn't great but not nearly as bad as California.Bad things you need to know about:1.) The rain is oversold but there is a marine layer over Western Washington for about 7 to 8 months out of the year. It's really, really grey.2.) The cost of living is terrible, everywhere.3.) Traffic is a nightmare along the I-5 and the I-405. Seattle is willfully shrinking traffic capacity and the east side simply can't build enough. Topography aggravates this. Avoid bridges.4.) Politics have radicalized over the past 20 years as Californians and people from the East Coast have flooded into the city for tech jobs.5.) Yet large corporations like Boeing, Starbucks, Microsoft, and especially Amazon dominate the political and economic landscape. It's really the worst of both worlds.Good things:1.) The economy is great.2.) World class food, festivals, beer.3.) Water, mountains, forests, all within an hour drive. It's an outdoors man's paradise.4.) Once you get away from Seattle most people are really chill. Sometimes too chill. 5.) Sea-Tac is a real international airport.6.) Great sports culture.Seattle is an 8 on the California scale. The east side is a 5. Most of the rest of Western Washington is a 3 or 4. If you can afford the cost of living and are capable of biting your tongue now and then, I'd say don't hesitate to give it a go if you have a real opportunity up there.",1.0

"Debatable. Feminism was probably one of these:A natural conclusion of liberal ideals meant the need to extend meritocratic parity to women and all other races. So we did. But sociopaths infiltrated feminism during this process, and they gained power inside the movement as the movement itself gained power. Once parity had been finally established, that was supposed to be it, movement over, everyone go home now. Except that would mean the sociopaths needed to relinquish their social power. Obviously that wasn't going to happen quietly, so they made sure the ghosts of inequalities past would always haunt the people in the movement, in order to justify its continued existence.---Feminism was always a supremacist movement. It just didn't become apparent that this was the goal until parity was established and they continued to hunger for more. Females on average get the short end of the stick through no fault of anyone's because males just have more phenotypical variability than females, which means they are almost always the ones who are on the extremes of any given scale. Among the smartest and most retarded, men naturally take the majority of those seats. A meritocracy, by virtue of what it is, cannot alter or compensate for this unfortunate(?) reality, and so men get the most prestigious and highest paying jobs and places in society. Some women despised this reality, and so they created feminism to tear down meritocracies. After all, a subgroup that can succeed on merit doesn't need a supremacy movement.---EDIT: On that last point: If that assessment is truly indicative of reality, then I suspect the demographic of KKKs members would be mostly below average white men (~90 IQ) that have to directly compete in the job market with the majority of average black men. ( also ~90 IQ) The jobs that are best for 90 IQ people get flooded by both these demographics competing with each other, so some of these white who couldn't succeed on merit decided to band together in a supremacy movement in order to violently retaliate against blacks that they perceived were ""taking their jobs""",0.0

"If this person found D&D so off-putting because of how the races separated themselves from each other, then it doesn't make sense for him to also be a huge fan of Tolkien's work.  The different races in Tolkien's world barely tolerate each other, only cooperating when their literal existence is at stake.  Elves live in their forests and shun travelers, and eventually altogether leave the world en masse because they find Middle Earth unbearable.  Dwarves hole up in their mountains and lock the doors, eventually dying when something more powerful than them shows up to take their stuff.  Men are either self-assured that they have no need of the other races, or are too busy trying to make a living to worry about other races.  Orcs, trolls, goblins, and the like exist to fulfill their own primal needs of hunger, conquest, and bloodshed; for them, the good races exist only to be slaughtered, enslaved, and eaten.And the Hobbits want nothing to do with any of them.Most D&D settings are going to naturally be more homogenous than Tolkien's Middle Earth.  I don't think that's a good or a bad thing, just that it is.  But for this self-proclaimed Tolkien enthusiast to pretend like he turned away from  D&D simply because of how the races were segregated is absolutely absurd.",1.0

"1.) I'm happy that Breitbart managed to get and release this document. 2.) The coverage on Breitbart I checked so far (I did not read all their articles, I only looked at a few) has warped and changed meanings in several places. These are close enough that the sources provided seem to substantiate them, yet if you check the whole manual or look at the evidence provided critically you'll see it's either misleading or false in several places:Example 1: Breitbart: Trump, Conspiracy Theorist - [One of the reasons Google identifies for allegedly widespread public disillusionment with internet free speech is that it “breeds conspiracy theories.”](http://archive.is/eHJTD#selection-549.0-553.151)Actual context: In [The Good Censor](https://www.scribd.com/document/390521673/The-Good-Censor-GOOGLE-LEAK) this slide is at the end of the section ""What’s the role of the tech firms in all of this?"", with previous slides detailing how tech firms are mismanaging the issues. Under this context the beginning of the slide ""When it comes to users, all of this bad behaviour and mismanagement..."" and then end ""... breeds conspiracy theories"" has a completely different meaning. Not that internet free speech is breeding conspiracy theories (as Breitbart says), but that the mismanagement of the companies (being intransparent about their algorithms and behavior) breeds such conspiracy stories by removing the ability from people to verify or falsify them easily. (I have to leave now, so only one example for now, I'll edit more in later).3.) In regards to the twitter reply by Bokhari you can see similar methods used. What is said is close to the truth in order to possibly mislead when not accurately checking, but false if you actually do check. One simple example here as well directly in the first tweet: >A few self-described ""centrists"" (who unlike Evil Partisans, are unbiased, non-tribal, always correct and never wrong) have decided The Good Censor is fake news. Ironically, they base this claim on a video that spreads horrendous fake news in its first 5 minutes.Besides the ""centrist"" point as /u/psa_sitch pointed out (but which can be forgiven as some self-proclaimed centrists retweeted it), this is also a false statement. None of them claimed ""The Good Censor"" is fake news, they claimed that Breitbarts reporting of the story is false, biased or misleading. ",1.0

"Okay I will bite.>for lying under oath would get punished the same as a typically very violent, and very physical act, First off what is being referenced here is not punishment for a violent crime versus an non violent crime. What is being referenced is where no violent crime has taken place and on the word of the accuser a person is sent to jail. So perjury can net a person a long, as in up to a lifetime in jail, where the punishment for perjury when discovered is trivial. No one is arguing that a person should get a light sentence for a violent crime against anyone. Or that the sentences for violent crime and perjury should be the same.>imagine being so big of an unashamed illiterate, that you actually believe shit like this Women receive far lighter sentences for the same type of crime as men across the board in all crime categories excluding none. Women caught committing the exact same crime as a man, ie she is a co-defendant, receive lighter sentences than their male co-defendants except in rare instances. The more severe the crime where both male and female defendants of the same crime the women will almost invariably receive years less in sentencing. >you have the fact that false rape allegations resulting in convictions aren't a widespread issue in the slightest according to just, well, virtually every credible authority on the subjectThis statement is incorrect. The number of false rape accusations being detected has greatly increased since the hysteria that the rape culture movement created by feminists highlighted that blindly believing an accuser caused more victims to be created. The whole title 9 fiasco where due process was removed from accused highlights the failing in the mentality. As you have pointed out above any legal system worth it salt has due process as a foundation stone of its legal system. Reading through your post history is pretty scary.

People who do not understand an issue yet feel confident that they are correct are fools in the most classical sense of the word.I was not attempting to educate. I was attempting to shed light on ignorance. It is too fucking easy to educate yourself for you to put the ""burden of proof"" on anyone but yourself unless you're in a debate setting. If you are ignorant in 2018 with a smartphone in your pocket it's because you CHOOSE to be that way. ""Read a book"" is a phrase I use to let people know that it's obvious that they do not take the time to consider the perspectives of others (and to belittle them because I value being informed and belittle those who are uninformed). Because once you've read a book by a person who believes things that you don't believe you immediately realize that your viewpoint isn't worth shit compared to the reality that we collectively experience.I spent 2 sec to google [""non-binary person interview""](http://lifeoutsidethebinary.com/post/91182016548/interview-with-a-nonbinary-person-about-their) and here's just one of 10 million results. If you want to sit through a poorly-edited highly-slanted view of events I'm sure Buzzfeed has made a dozen youtube videos about nonbinary people. Just like all other perspectives you expose yourself to you will have to be a critical thinker (which I think we can all agree on considering this is the GamerGate subreddit). There are no ""right books;"" there are only books. There are no ""right perspectives;"" there are only perspectives. Some people's perspectives are informed and compassionate. Some people's perspectives are uninformed and uncaring. Who's viewpoints do you value?Make choices. If you want respect then give it. If you want condemnation then spit it at others. If you want ignorance then spread it around. Everybody has choices. And we should all respect each others' personal choices because none of us are right about this world.Hope that helps.

You can find primary sources there if you want. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_socialism                 The article reflects what I learned from African students and immigrants I've listened to. This is not even considering BLM, which  is explicitly pan-African Marxism.                  >muh 2 party system, of course we won't vote to deport ourselves.

Like I said, mass immigration screws with democracy. Traditional African values are not the same as Canadian values and it is reflected in the infrastructure of Canada vs that in any African country. They believe in pooled resources and equal outcomes.

"I thought it was decent when it came out, but Waid is overrated.   A big tell in a flawed story is if your introduce a key conflict--it may not  be the main conflict, it may only be the second or third conflict--but if it's a key conflict to the story, and it's resolved by some lazy deus ex machina (in this instance, dei ex machina embodied in Shazam), that resolves a critical conflict...the story is flawed.   One of the big conceits of the book was that there was this prophecy about the bat and the eagle in conflict.   through three issues it was implied it was Bats v Supes, then SHAZAM PLOT TWIST, it's Bats v Wonder Woman, and in issue four they're duking it out and SHAZAM! instead of resolving the intractable conflict between side A and side B...humans decide to nuke super humans (thus ending the conflict between Bats and WW...which was a freaking prophecy and treated as critical to the story up to that point) and Supes and a brainwashed Shazam have to stop the bomb (and half fail in doing so). Ok.  You ended the Bats v WW conflict with a distraction.  It's a freaking Elseworlds story.  You are given the license to have consequences.   Let key characters die.   Let one side win.  Have cajones.   Re.  Solve.  The.  Con.  Flict.  Waid is tame.  His personal antics have more drama and consequences than his fiction.  Dude could never create anything new, write some science fiction novel, build a universe.  He's a fanboy that was competent in managing the month to month tension of comic book writing, but good at nothing else.  Neil Gaiman could invent and write outside of comics.  Joe Hill.  Even Kevin Smith, who started in film then went to comics in back.  That's impressive.  But these fanboy writers are just dull hacks (Waid, Busiek).  I don't need grim and gritty or anti-grim and gritty or any theme or motif, just invention and creativity.   I never, ever understood why those fanboy writers were put on a pedestal in the mid to late 90s.  Tame writers.  They're the same quality as Roy Thomas, with the exception that Roy a) actually created new borderline A lister characters (Vision) and quality B listers (Black Knight) (Waid and Busiek have done neither), B) Thomas was responsible for much of the Marvel Universe webbing, creating connections across character families that created the networked feel of the Marvel U in the 70s  (see what he did with Asgard and the Eternals and Ragnarok...pretty ingenious for comic writing) and carried in the 80s (that even Lee and Kirby (the creators) failed to do), and C) isn't worshipped as a god like Waid and Busiek are.  I'm listening to Scriver's broadcast yesterday on Waid and DinC, and yikes....I'm torn between wanting these stories about Waid to be true and not be true, because if they are true, man, what a despicable human being (him and Dan Slott) and if not true, then that type of trolling accusations just degrade society further (in our anonymous cyber/accusation oriented culture, I don't know what to believe is true when people speak roughly anonymously about others...makes me a skeptic).

""Even strong advocates for rape victims admit that false accusations sometimes occur. The real debate is regarding the frequency of these false claims. Some suggest that only 2% of rape accusations are false (a rate that is similar to that of non-sex offenses), while others state that the rate is higher (e.g., 8%).There are several possible reasons for this wide range of estimates. For one, it appears that some analyses conflate unfounded and false. Legally speaking, the term unfounded describes claims shown deemed not verifiable or prosecutable.A report may be considered unfounded if:If there is a lack of physical evidence or there are a large number of inconsistencies between existing evidence and the victim’s claim.Thus, the terms unfounded and false are not the same.

"> It’s not a privilege to be coddled. I’ve seen feminists use the term “female privilege” plenty of times. You can search the term in any social media (if you can sift through all the antifeminist comments and posts bashing all of feminism because women have these few “benefits” from patriarchy)It's comical that you pretend like feminism has no problem acknowledging female privilege, even as you refuse to use the term yourself and feel the need to put even the word ""benefits"" in scare quotes. Hell, go on a half dozen feminist communities and start a conversation about ""female privilege"". Let me know how positive your reception is. Odds are you'll be derisively called an ""MRA"" and shown the door.> “Presumption of joint custody OR sole custody” isn’t that what men want?I haven't seen too many men arguing for a presumption of sole custody. Presumption of joint/equal custody, however, is something many father's rights groups do fight for, and the NOW fights *against* this, often with arguments about how joint custody is merely a tool that men use to abuse their former spouses.> Pointing out the fact that women are more likely to be victims is not denying that men can be victims.

A fetus is not the same as a child. Autonomy is not the same as avoiding a bill for 18 years.Most formulations of legal parental surrender involve surrendering your rights and responsibilities *before* childbirth. Feminists seem to flip their shit at that idea, as well. That said, single mothers do have the right to [have a child and then decide they don't want anything to do with it with no repercussions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safe-haven_law).> And feminists reaction to itThat's a nice attempt to deflect from the fact that an influential feminist organisation (Women's March) promoted Donna Hylton as a speaker on the mistreatment of women by the legal system.

Of course you'd respect the other persons wishes, and if you're not both on the same page, you wouldn't do it. Him breaking up with her from just asking might mean that she jumped ship before she told him she wanted an open relationship. Perhaps he already knew and was waiting for her to confront him about it, and she was here dishonest...  I say good for him getting out. However, if her story is completely true, then he is overreacting. Him leaving has done enough damage to make sure she never ever thinks about other men ever again. 5 years is a long time. We get very comfortable in relationships, and look for new things to spice things up, it's only human. Like a prisoner will eventually look for a way to escape. That's why I believe non\-monogamous relationships will soon become more popular in the future, because relationships are supposed to be about love, not physical, and the church is losing influence over our sexual decisions.   Anyway, he's overrating if it's true, because a thought and fantasy is just that. It takes a real world experience to snap you out of it. This is why people cheat. If you talk about an Open relationship, and get this reaction, you're never gonna do it again. Likely give up on that fantasy as well.

"I think being a Nazi, an actual Nazi, not just right wing, is cause to be assaulted. I don’t mean people that say “death to all Muslims” on twitter, or even racist people. I mean people who are members of Neo-Nazi organizations. If you would like to know why, it’s because Nazis use our love of free speech and the free marketplace of ideas to undermine those very things. Nazis do not give a fuck about freedom of speech, they just know that you do give a fuck. They actively want to remove freedom of speech and freedom of movement and freedom of association and freedom of being alive from people simply for being born not white. It’s naive to think that the free marketplace of ideas can defeat these people, because they aren’t actually participating in the marketplace. They’re gaming the marketplace to co-opt it and destroy it. And people are too stupid to notice it happening. It’s obvious that the marketplace of ideas has failed as the violence we see at protests now is a symptom of that failure. I believe that there are ideas that can undermine the entire structure of our country and we must do everything we can to protect ourselves from these ideas. If you think America cannot be defeated by an idea, then you need to understand that America as founded on ideas and defeated Britain with those ideas. The war with radical Islamic terrorists is going to be won with an idea. Fuck man, it’s arguable that the idea of America and the H-bomb is what has kept the world in relative peace since WW2.

I was born and grew up in a former Soviet satellite state in Eastern Europe which was ruled by a genuine hardcore communist party for half a century (not the Antifa larping fragile mangina cucks you see on the streets today). We essentially had one and only one news source distributed by the Party and all other alternative sources were completely subservient to the Party anyway. Anyone who even tried to think differently was sent on a one way trip to a concentration camp... 'scuse me - ""labor"" camp. And this was going on until 1989. Trust me when I tell you - I am painfully aware and ""trained"" to spot bias, it's pretty much a second nature.I guess my point is that I'm not that much disappointed by the BBC bias, that's a given.

Both did find that women took more vacation days (even before they had kids), but the size of the difference varied quite a lot. More research is needed.

"This isn't about me gatekeeping identities. It's about how society at large will react. With transwomen, they are biologically male but they go through numerous processes to pass as female so that society will treat them as such. To try to pass as non-binary is going to get people to think you're either an effeminate guy or a tomboy. They're not going to see someone as being outside male or female. Do people make assumptions about gender? Sure, but they're right most of the time. You can't just go out in public, look like a man, then claim you're female and expect everyone around you to magically know you're supposed to be female. It may work among friends and in very specific spaces, but to the public at large, that doesn't work.I'm well aware of dealing with people acting like experts on things they don't understand. I deal with this a lot on numerous subject matters like my autism. It's even worse over the Internet. I don't claim to be informed on non-binary. I freely admit my ignorance when it comes to that. However it doesn't mean I won't question it just like how I question everything else. Hell people question me a lot over me saying I'm a transwoman.You're right. A lot of the stuff that can probably be found about non-binary are poorly done Buzzfeed study videos. Even if I did get informed, if I still choose to talk shit it doesn't mean I'm not informed. Perhaps if I heard what non-binary meant from a non-SJW viewpoint I would be a lot more understanding. I'm already in the same boat with being transgender and much of the transgender people mentioned in this sub are SJWs, making it look bad on us non-SJW transgenders.

You could maybe make case of SEED's ZAFT being such a case due to taking heavy inspiration from MSG Zeon but it also have some differences that make such claims harder to make. Gundam X's Space Revolutionary Army could be stretched to maybe fit due to again taking inspiration from Zeon but the series don't really focus much time on that faction so it's hard to know.I don't think you find such state in G, Wing, Turn A or 00, maybe cases could be made for AGE, Reconguista in G or Iron-Blooded Orphans I haven't completed them so I don't know but even if so that still plenty of series that lack such states which makes saying ""almost always"" a bit much.>Legend of the Galactic Heroes, a Japanese novel series adapted into multiple anime shows, also contains a similar government called the Galactic Empire.I wouldn't say the Galactic Empire is primarily inspired by a WWII-era Germany but rather 19 century Prussia or the German Empire with the focus on how important nobility is to advance in the ranks of the Galactic Empire. >Hetalia: Axis Powers portrays a group of anthropomorphized countries with a sympathetic, long-suffering Germany as the main character.

"I agree completely, especially about how hard it is to be a non-leftist transperson and how many people don't understand autism (30%+ amiright?).But: you HAVE heard the definition of ""nonbinary"" from a non-SJW. It's just everything that isn't male or female (which means that it is INCREDIBLY broad. That's why it doesn't make sense to say there aren't nonbinary people).You're right that society is totally geared to label people into M and F. But that's changing because people are changing.Humans are naturally biased to reduce any topic down to a binary. But as we know that doesn't reflect reality; it is simply a shortcoming of the way we process information (and normally it isn't a shortcoming and it helps us solve a lot of our problems).IMO 20 years ago a **huge** portion of society didn't *believe* in trans identities. They looked at a person and said: ""that's a dude in a dress"" or ""I bet that bulldyke is a carpet-muncher"" (or whatever they said. I wasn't old enough to notice so I'll just be as offensive and basic as I can imagine lol). But now trans identities are commonly recognized and generally understood (especially since the time when GG started). I foresee that a similar level of understanding will organically (aka slowly) spread over the next 20 years about people who don't feel comfortable identifying as male or female.I might be completely off-base. Maybe society is only capable of being tolerant towards MtF and FtM and nothing else. But that isn't really the way societal movements move from my understanding of history.",0.0

Gamers got upset at this new evidence of a long-standing problem, and it kind of became ""the straw that broke the camel's back"".Rather than admit that it's wrong to take sex from game developers in exchange for good reviews, the games ""journalists"" decided to deflect from the issue by pretending that what the gamers were angry about was that a girl made a video game and that it got a good review. Games ""journalists"" all talked together privately and a couple of days later they all released articles that pretended that this whole debacle was about gamers hating women, and not about games ""journalists"" dicking female developers in exchange for good reviews.No matter how the subject was brought up, they would plug their ears about the actual issues and try to shift the focus to ""gamers hate women"". Then the gamers started really going for the throat, doing things like reporting them for not disclosing sponsorships and affiliate links, doing all kinds of work to essentially expose all of their bullshit.Meanwhile the games ""journalists"" kept doubling down, people started faking death threats to make this seem like a credible issue, and the opportunist women and ""journalists"" set up patreons and kickstarters to suck dry any chump who thought they were serious.Nowadays, Trump is Making America Great Again, all of these games ""journalists"" and white knights are being found out to be accused (and thus by their own standards, guilty) of sexually assaulting women, everyone's well aware that games ""journalism"" is just paid advertisements and fake news, and we're over here laughing and having fun playing the same kinds of video games we used to, for the most part.",0.0

"“Feminist ​Mein Kampf​”Our Struggle is My Struggle: Solidarity Feminism as an Intersectional Reply to Neoliberal and ChoiceFeminismAccepted by Af ilia: Journal of Women and Social Work, leading feminist social work journalIn the name of Maria Gonzalez, Ph.D. (fictitious) of the (fictitious) Feminist Activist Collective for Truth(FACT)Discipline/subdiscipline: feminist social workNote: The last two thirds of this paper is based upon a rewriting of roughly 3600 words of Chapter 12 ofVolume 1 of Mein Kampf, by Adolf Hitler, though it diverges significantly from the original. This chapteris the one in which Hitler lays out in a multi-point plan which we partially reproduced why the Nazi Partyis needed and what it requires of its members. The first one third of the paper is our own theoreticalframing to make this attempt possible.Summary: Feminism which foregrounds individual choice, responsibility, female agency, and strengthcan be countered by a feminism which unifies in solidarity around the victimhood of the mostmarginalized women in society.Purpose: That we could find Theory to make anything (in this case, part of Chapter 12 of Volume 1 ofMein Kampf with buzzwords switched in) acceptable to journals if we put it in terms of politicallyfashionable arguments and existing scholarship. Of note, while the original language and intent of MeinKampf has been significantly changed to make this paper publishable and about feminism, the relianceupon the politics of grievance remains clear, helping to justify our use of the term “grievance studies” forthese fields.Notes on Status:Peer reviewed and rejected by Feminist TheoryAccepted by Af ilia, August 21, 2018Proofs approved, September 19, 2018Selected Reviewer Comments:“This is an interesting paper seeking to further the aims of inclusive feminism by attending to the issue ofallyship/solidarity.” Reviewer 1, Af ilia“I am very sympathetic to the core arguments of the paper, such as the need for solidarity and theproblematic nature of neoliberal feminism.” -Reviewer 1, Feminist Theory“While I am extremely sympathetic to this article’s argument and its political positioning, I am afraid thatI cannot recommend publication in its current form.” -Reviewer 2, Feminist Theory“The reviewers are supportive of the work and noted its potential to generate important dialogue forsocial workers and feminist scholars.” -Co-Editor in Chief, Af ilia, first review",0.0

"> The link you posted does not reinforce this point, it merely says more people intermarry, but that is easily correlated with a rise in other ethnicities and the trend of whites to become a national minority.How does the rise in other ethnicities explain away the increasing trend of intermarriage as evidence of immigrants' children mingling? We're looking at the effects of increased diversity, so the increase in other ethnicities is a given. The question is whether they stay clustered or mingle.Are you really trying to say that Whites aren't participating in these intermarriages? > The most common racial or ethnic pairing among newlywed intermarried couples is one Hispanic and one white spouse (42%). Next most common are one white and one Asian spouse (15%) and one white and one multiracial spouse (12%).Looks like we're all mingling! Or, is that what really bothers you? > Depends on the immigrants, not all immigrants are weighed equally. This is the part people like you always forget. For example, Jamaican and Haitian immigrants commit way more crime than Dutch and German immigrants. Literally zero people on the Right are claiming all immigrants are the same, but it is statistically more likely for Mexican immigrants to commit crime than Japanese people. Those are numbers you cannot debate, which is likely why you strawman the conservative position.If you think that ethnicity itself drives criminal behaviour, then you're being blatantly racist. Crime rates are driven by inequality, and inequality often breaks along ethnic lines. That's the only reason there is any correlation between crime rates and ethnicity. https://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/abs/10.1162/003465300559028Sadly, this widespread confusion fuels policies which see Canadian police forces funded, not based on actual crime rates, but based on the (mis)perceived threats posed by minorities. https://www.mcgill.ca/newsroom/channels/news/perceived-threat-aboriginals-and-visible-minorities-255277The point isn't to judge individuals based on what groups they belong to. It's to build the kinds of communities that produce less crime. Spoiler: those are diverse democracies with lower inequality and socialist policies. > Diversity for the sake of diversity is not a strength. That is retarded. There is absolutely no data to back that up. If you believe so, you will have to explain to us how blacks, jews, and indians have different brains than whites. You'll have to explain how on a genetic level they are different, as well as cultural. To argue for diversity being a strength, you are in fact arguing for racism.Not sure why I would have to explain anything about various brains, especially since I already cited evidence showing that more diverse communities with more immigrants have less crime. Maybe take a few breathes and revisit that PBS link.I'm not saying ""diversity at all costs,"" any more than you're saying ""all immigration is bad."" But generally increased diversity IS good. There is evidence for that. You're just refusing to look at it. ",0.0

"I don't think that's strictly the case. It isn't good improvisational skills that are required, tho they may help. What's required is a talented actor who really understands their character, the story, the scene and the genre.Although not comedy, one example I can give is Margot Robbie and Leo DiCaprio is Wolf of Wall Street. In one scene, she loses her temper with him and slaps him. The slap was improvised and when Robbie profusely apologised afterwards, DiCaprio assured her she did a fantastic job and did what felt right for the character.Another example, also DiCaprio and also drama, in a scene in Django Unchained he actually cuts his hand on a broken glass, and without missing a beat, continues in character and wraps his hand. That made the final edit.Now I know comedy is different from drama, I'm not claiming they're the same. But there's a difference between improv as they did in GB2016 with Paul Fieg, and improv \*in character\* and in context. You can't make a good film the way he did, just letting the camera roll and the actors do whatever. They need a script and to let the actors do it their way, perhaps a few takes to try different things with the director directing them as needed.The trouble comes when the director doesn't have a clear enough vision for the final product.

They can spread if their mycelium, similar to a plants roots, are broken into pieces. Each piece just grows into a separate organism. But that's just asexual reproduction of fungi. They can also reproduce sexually, but I wouldn't call it ""normal sexual reproduction."" At least not in a heteronormative way. Instead of sexes, they have mating types. Instead of anything that can be called sperm or an egg, both mating types create the same type of gamete. Some species can sexually reproduce with themselves, while switching between mating types as they do. Then you get to bacteria, and everything just breaks down entirely. They reproduce asexually, but they also engage in horizontal gene transfer, easily exchanging DNA with entirely different species. Asexual reproduction can be incredibly efficient and diverse.

I saw the original first and saw how Ben handled himself and after watching that piece of shit Cenk flat out lie about every single aspect of it and refuse to show the full clip that proved Bob was a violent nutjob while Ben was a calm badass, well it was my wake up call. I have always hated feminists and PC culture fuckwits, I saw the Escapist go from a cool place to be to being a shithole full of stuck up SJW faggots around 2009-2010, then when they started cramming the feminazi shit down our throats in the form of Scamkesian, I turned right off that. But I had always considered myself fairly left wing politically (well, to be precise I considered both sides to be nothing but a bunch of lying cunts) but after that brazen propaganda by TYT I started reexamining ""stupid and evil"" right wing voices. Now all my favourite political commentators are right wing (excluding Sargon, but hes more a centrist so hes fine) and two of the favourite comedians are flat out right wing (Crowder and Razorfist) and I even splashed out and bought a Mug club subscription a few months ago. Now I genuinely love [Ann Coulter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0K5z7vwJg58) and after the shitshow the left caused with Supreme Court Justice Kavanaugh, I am so sickened by the left that I consider them to be traitors to the nation and its people.",1.0

A neutral evil Human Sorcerer who had max ranks in Profession (Lawyer) since game one.He was a scrawny man, tall and lanky. Fine black hair and the like, and the traditional evil goatee, And yes, he did stroke it occasionally.Well, It all started when the party went to a little farming village who's average IQ was likely on par with a jar of mayo... On the way out, my Lawyer had a brilliant idea to get some money... The only shop in town is essentially a pawn shop, so I go out to the fields and pick up a few rocks... I cast Light on them... And bring them back to the shop as ""Health Stones, As long as you carry one, you'll never grow ill! Look at how they glow!"" The moron gobbled it up because the town didn't know I was a spell-caster of any acclaim.That was the start of it..Second major evil act of mine was using my characters extensive expertise in the law to force a Ma & Pa style Inn to sell to him otherwise he was going to have the place seized for owed taxes... He then turned it into a whore-house... And then burned it down for the insurance money.After that the party Paladin got fed up with my way and challenged me to a duel of blades, I accepted and surrendered quickly.. And then using my insanely high charisma I convince the Paladin that I've changed my evil ways, that I'll give it all up... So, he allows me to buy him a drink... Next thing he knows, he wakes up in a motel room with a dead hooker on the floor, and outlawed narcotics on the nightstand.I retired the character shortly thereafter, going off the RP reason that he went into hiding to avoid retribution from the Paladin's Order.Good times..",0.0

"You know what you are saying fits perfectly with that parody name.Honestly I don't know why most of the world doesn't' seem to *get it*.Back in the day- maybe. Then again you used to need a fuckton of training to be able to fight well enough to defend yourself outside of a fluke. Even then what lots of people don't seem to understand is that if a government doesn't allow you to defend yourself(sometimes even legally at all with improved on the stop weapons) with weapons then they don't give a shit whether you live or die- which makes them a shit abusive government.I can get wanting to have a sweet spot for that, but it's pretty clear most governments just think they are a better breed of human than those they rule over. That is why I think it's so fucking retarded when the dipshits say ""Common sense gun control"". For one the ""control"" is a giant rippling red flag, for two in the us you already fucking have things that are frankly according to the Constitution ""infringements"", that lots of people find fairly tolerable even those who own and use lots of weapons. It's funny how they seem to think their aren't background checks when the only way you can not have them is limited as fuck sales between people- which you can't really control anyway as it's nigh impossible to track.If you do any half decent amount of business with guns you *have* to get a FFL. Even a pawn shop that may have like 10 guns top at any given time would have to have a fucking FFL.I'm sick of either complete ignorant dumbasses that don't even try to do any real search- even the basis trying to act like they know what is good for everyone else, or worse yet deliberate fucking liars- that still probably don't know shit but they know just enough to know they are wrong and crooked.When you think about it, control is the big word. Especially why they not only want to legal for extreme cases but act like abortion is a *virtue*. They don't want us filthy plebs breeding too much, unless we are their slaves. I mean that was the point of abortion with cunts like Sanger. Kill all the darkies so they can't rise up against the whites- or as of now, and maybe as of always the *right kind of whites*- not saying jews I'm just saying the ""elite class""Everything about marxism is about class warfare. How to get all the plebs fighting against each other so the elites are safe. Just when the soviet's started it the crooked power hungry ones weren't the elites yet, so they had to fix that. After that they had to make it so only *they* could say who gets to be in the elite class.The more things change, the more only the names change and the elitist power hungry crooks are always the same kind of people- besides in random exceptions.You could say I'm paranoid- but am I *really*? Are we really all that different now as the human speices save for techonolgy than when we had fredual lords, and only the right kind of people who served the guys at the tippy top got to be in the peerage? If someone basically was so awesome even though they weren't in the elite to begin with they had to be let in it pissed the elites off so much, because it shows that if anyone is good enough they need to be let in, or they can always just break down the door and take it for themselves, and that pisses them off.Anyone here read or watch Berserk?

"This seems to a bit of an idiotic topic but there is some merit it in perhaps... though  I have seen anime that does the opposite. I'm not talking about like pointless abuse. Honestly in a lot of anime, they abuse the concept of smacking a guy around because he is a dense fucker and can't knock before entering a bathroom.This annoys me a bit too but it isn't a monolith. Take Maken-Ki ecchi as fuck anime. That happens to the main dude, he literally forgets because he rooms with a few chicks. Now it's possible to forget, but in a small defense of them. If you forget 24/7 that's being fucking inconsiderate. Secondly this guy does intentionally peep on chicks sometimes, so it's hard for him to claim innocence because sometimes he really *isn't* innocent.As much as I found inuyasha to be garbage for this, and other reasons, it made a lot more sense in Ranma 1/2. Ranma *went out of his way* to poke at his, somewhat betrothed's, insecurities. Sure people should get over their insecurities but when someone has insecurities about not being feminine enough maybe when you have to live with them you shouldn't tell them like 8 times a day they suck at being a chick. Ranma was a dick to both Akane and other people at least half the time.Now, on the flip side you have recent shows like konosuba and Aho Girl.Kazuma right out states he's having none of this bullshit. he will also smack a bitch if he thinks she's being an idiot, not that ti works with darkness cause she's a kinky masochist and gets turned on by that, even when he acts disgusted at her behavior in public and means it. He will routinely tell aqua she is useless and a bitch in public- because she is.In Aho girl main dude is possibly a bit of a dick but he has lived around the main sex obsessed bitch for his entire life, her precocious ass would routinely do things to him in their childhood that he didn't want to do that might well border on sexual assault, he was too physically weak to stop her. This lead him into gaining more strength, probably mostly just happened because puberty. He now due to her current actions and past actions *knocks the fuck* out of this chick, who is in fact so fucking stupid she routinely gets zeros on all of her tests **all of them**. His aggressive, pretty much assault and battery, treatment of this chick scares everyone around him especially the other chicks, but he just has no more patience for this chick who is selfish, stupid as fuck,inconsiderate, and a **MEGA THOT** obsessed with his dick.So both extremes exist and largely played for comedy. The chicks doing it to dudes is more common but let's see western media even as a joke try to do some of the dudes not putting up with chicks bullshit.

"People whine this sub doesnt support liberals or hates them. This isn't true. Here's the thing. And reminder, jokes require truth as an element to be funny.The left can't meme. Why would shitty memes get up voted in general? They don't. They left can't meme. One in five hundred sure. So left wing memes don't go anywhere because they suck.The left can't argue anything past surface level bs. Many of them have the depth of a puddle, mentally, and can argue one position. The one you read everywhere. The one jerked off in every leftist subreddit. It's never taken beyond that. Ever. It's just jerked off. People whine fox news is bias. Fox news started as a Christian conservative network to combat leftist perceived slant, so, suggesting they are bias when they literally started to combat liberal news is beyond retarded. It's tiring listening to leftist media whine about trump all day and not report actual news while saying they are neutral and its frustrating talking to people who can't see the difference. It's boring talking to people that do the same. You don't learn anything you just keeping staring at the same wall, never walking through any doors. Talking to a leftist is watching paint dry. Everything's a cheer leading slogan. Their views fit into the character limit of a twitter comment. What they promote and what they do are 100% the opposite. The left act like women. It's tough being around a guy who acts like a woman. It's tough talking to loony leftist women.Its not that the left isn't tolerated here, it's that they are often horrible stereotypes with nothing interesting to say that offers critical thought, funny thought, etc. Nothing that's worth up voting, nothing that orzbluefog thinks is amazing. A leftist laying out a step by step plan of how anything they offer actually works, that would be a good thing to add. Yet, nothing. Go look at a libertarian party and you'll see a real breakdown of how something needs to be done. Look at leftist, it's just ""get government to do it"" or ""raise taxes, create a tax.""So firstly why did you read this (I'm killing time in a hotel) and secondly I want to hear a leftist actually lay out a plan and be the first leftist to actually do it.****Tldr**** fuck all anything worth reading.

"> True Yes, but don’t forget there is competition between tribes, and those who are more based in reality fare better.Not necessarily true. A good example would be Inuit prophetic traditions for determining where to hunt; burning bones and looking at the cracks to tell you where to go actually does produce better outcomes than other hunting strategies, and this isn't unusual for traditional superstitious practices. Not because it works as divination, but because it's a low-tech randomizer that prevents animals from learning which areas to avoid. You can read more about this stuff [here.](https://scholars-stage.blogspot.com/2018/08/tradition-is-smarter-than-you-are.html)Only rarely is an appeal to reason the most effective strategy in convincing someone of something, and that's almost always when dealing with someone who has been trained to think rationally. If rationality were the default, the Enlightenment would not have been an event, it would have been the default.> Not to mention the small implicit bias towards reality in individuals will mean there will be individuals bleeding off from tribes that are less based in reality.This is begging the question. Also, people switching tribes was never common. Different language, different religious traditions, different cultures, suspicion of outsiders, etc.> For our latest example, the Brett Kavanaugh media extravaganza, polling data shows support for republicans is growing and the democratic lead in voter enthusiasm has been halved.Not necessarily evidence that people are dissuaded by irrationality, but rather that they are dissuaded by an attack on their own personally held values. ""Innocent until proven guilty"" is the bedrock of the American legal system; the one thing that basically everybody actually knows.> Again, everything you have can only be from a society more based in reality than not.Because the individuals who invent all this shit, a small fraction of the population, work on rational principles.

"That was decided in 1973, with language that had no definition as to what an obscenity actually is, how one actually determines what is an obscenity, and what any of the terms involved are.You might as well argue that the Supreme Court upheld slavery at one point, which it did, so why argue against slavery?As I said, the Supreme Court has attempted to punt at every opportunity on deciding the actual use of Miller or exact definition of obscenity. In the age of porn on demand, and expanding protections for non-political free speech in America, one good criminal prosecution that doesn't end in a plea deal could see an appeal go to the SC.And morals are not the basis of the Constitution. That's a conservative fantasy. Rights are not based on morals. They're granted by the virtue of existing. Free speech doesn't exist because your sky wizard commands it. It's a right derived from the need of the individual, and it doesn't require the agreement of the state or of others. The Constitution guarantees individual rights, not group rights, because those rights exist naturally for the individual. Obscenity is the very definition of a group punishment upon the individual, the offense of others as a reason to inflict tyranny on the minority.Honestly, conservatives make me sick sometimes. The willingness of such types to lock someone up for making drawings or writing novels, to deprive them of liberty because their sky god's jimmies are rustled, as interpreted by self-proclaimed priests and their captive politicians.Anyone that would lock up another human being for scribbles on paper should never speak of standing for anything resembling human dignity.

One might rationalize this as Western journos not serving Japan-only news, but this hasn't stopped stories of similar scope before, like Japanese game announcements from Tokyo Game Show that may not necessarily get a Western release. Plus, this story very much has a relevant Western element to it, not only in that it will impact all future efforts to release Japanese games to the West, but also in that Sony's new censorious policy is being dictated by Westerners.Looking back further, there also appears to be little coverage of the latest Senran Kagura game being delayed and censored due to the policy, the first sign of the new danger.

"SJW shit had... something to do with this place.Lemme go back to the source: [this is the comment thread that directly led to KiA's creation](https://i.imgur.com/kAjutQX.png). This has nothing to do with SJWs.The most common archive thrown around to prove that ""KiA was always about SJWs"" is [this one](https://web.archive.org/web/20140829010205/reddit.com/r/kotakuinaction), taken four days after the sub's creation. ""We were talking about SJWs to boycott, we were talking about SJW influence, how is that not proof that KiA was always about SJWs?"" Because you're talking about corrupt journalists to boycott, and essentially [reposting shit that was already on TiA](https://www.reddit.com/r/TumblrInAction/comments/2f2dxh/this_is_an_actual_panel_at_pax_prime/) at the time. KiA was effectively born out of TiA, so, again, the overlap of anti-SJWs is natural. Proof of SJW shit being a driving force? I don't think so, unless you'd be willing to say that callout culture is also part of why this sub exists.[Here's where the sub starting being shaped into GamerGate proper](https://web.archive.org/web/20140908032005/http://www.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/comments/2fcb16/good_times_people_heres_a_comprehensive_faq_about/), courtesy of yours truly. ""But Hat, you used SJW in that post! You talked about spreading ideologies! The commenters talk about SJWs!"" Well, you got me there, everyone was throwing around the term ""SJW"" like anti-GG/aGGro hadn't been coined yet, so yeah, that's what we used to describe our opponents. Take [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/comments/2escbh/zqs_sjw_friends_currently_attacking_fireflys_adam/), for example. Ideologies? Yeah, that's what I was talking about when I said ""SJW stuff being pushed by outlets like Kotaku and Polygon,"" those were the main targets at the time, the places that everyone shat on.I know it kind of looks like me hand-waving away a bunch of relevant shit (trust me, I've heard that one before), but my main point is this: The cornerstone of KiA, and the reason why it exists, is because of the exposure of gaming journalism's rotten core. That's what drove boycotts, that's what drove the emails to advertisers, that's what led to digs and finds, and what kept KiA active. The community was already mostly anti-SJW, due to overlap with TiA, but that doesn't necessarily make anti-SJWism part of the bedrock of the sub any more than pointing out retards on Twitter.Somewhat ironically, while finding my old links for this, I ran across [this post](https://web.archive.org/web/20141102221352/http://www.reddit.com:80/r/KotakuInAction/comments/2g7975/gamergate_is_not_just_about_corruption/).

"Yep. Cannabis is the middle of nowhere (and even city) police departments’ bread and butter. Under current federal legislation it is permissible for departments to seize assets whenever they have “reasonable suspicion” that the suspect has been distributing “narcotics”. They DO NOT HAVE TO PROVE THIS IN COURT. THE SUSPECT CAN BE CLEARED OF ALL CHARGES AND THEY CAN KEEP THEIR SEIZED MONEY AND PROPERTY. Up to 90% of assets seized can be kept by the seizing local authorities, with the remainder being handed up the food chain to the feds.   The reason given is that it strangles cartels by cutting off their resources. Can they explain seizing a couple’s home because their son was accused of selling small quantities of drugs? Pretty sure these otherwise unblemished citizens are not secretly El Chapo. SERIOUSLY GOOGLE IT.   Here’s where marijuana comes in. Because of the PROVEN fact that marijuana does not have physically addictive properties, causes no craving or withdrawal beyond that which would be experienced by someone if you took their television away, it is a substance that you have a decent chance of finding at any given stop and search. Every kind of person in this country smokes weed. The CEOs, the preachers, the moms, the saints, the sinners. It has zero impact on a normal healthy person’s ability to function and live a normal, successful life. Its “addictive” properties are like those of sex or food, it’s only addictive to someone who has problems with emotions, self control, and/or discipline. Most humans can pick it up and put it down as they please, and those who can’t would have found something to have a problem with anyway. Leaving marijuana as a schedule 1 narcotic and continuing the charade of pretending to believe that it “kills kids” is what keeps local law enforcement in business in Bumblescum, NowhereState. Unlike the NYPD where they have plenty of tax dollars rolling in per capita and they just use marijuana statutes to intimidate and harass an overwhelmingly poor and marginalized sector of the city, there is not enough actual crime to sustain their justifications for keeping a force at all, let alone a force as large as they do have, and there is no money in taking down actual criminals (like rapists). So what is a corrupt police/sheriff’s department to do?   You are a victim of the continuing playacting where law enforcement and other institutions pretend that they genuinely believe that marijuana is “a dangerous drug”.   Everyone I have spoken to in healthcare understands that the health risks come from smoking via combustion methods and have the same risks as smoking cigarettes, except without a proven addictive substance involved that causes clinically documented physical craving and withdrawal. Additionally, the several contacts I have in law enforcement are extremely aware that marijuana is a relatively benign substance that is used as a tool against poor and dark people.   Read the description of the first hearing to make marijuana illegal. They have a direct quote of an argument used to justify the legislation that I will paraphrase here: “.. you give a Mexican in the field a puff of a marijuana cigarette and he thinks he’s a bullfighter in Toledo”. More racism and classism. On the federal level, they claimed to have “isolated the active ingredient “ and injected it into dogs’ brains, a couple of which died. THC was not isolated and identified until WWII or possibly just after. This “study” was “performed” many years before this discovery.     An educated population is the only cure, but I doubt it will happen in my lifetime. ",0.0

"> Actress Keira Knightley went on the Ellen Degeneres show on Tuesday and said that her daughters are banned from watching Cinderella and The Little Mermaid, why? Because she wants her daughters to know she doesn’t need no man…no really. She stated that those films send the message that women should wait for a handsome prince to rescue them or that women should give up everything for a man.>”Because, you know, she waits around for a rich guy to rescue her. Don’t! Rescue yourself, obviously.”***No she fucking doesn’t watch the damn movie***Ariel takes her fate and life into her own hands and sells her voice for legs to go get the man she wants. Eric doesn’t save Ariel from *shit* — she saves *him* from drowning and then wants his dick. Stuff happens on land, Ariel breaks the agreement, and then Ursula takes Ariel captive per the terms of their contract, but King Triton — Ariel’s *father* — offers himself in her place, and then Eric and Ariel *work together* to kill Ursula and save Triton and the world.Keira Knightley is banning her daughter from watching a movie that features a female protagonist who retains complete agency for almost the entire movie and directly drives 100% of the action because she herself has evidently not seen the movie and knows nothing about it. The core message of Disney’s adaptation of The Little Mermaid is that pursuing your dreams is *hard as fuck* and any number of things can go disastrously wrong — including things that will be *your own fault* for trusting the wrong people or taking the wrong approach — but that if you don’t take on that risk and that responsibility then your chance of achieving your goals is ***0.00%***.This movie didn’t kick off the Disney Renaissance by being shitty or backwards, it did it because its themes resonate at a fundamental archetypal level. It’s teaching you a lesson you’ve always known but that you forgot, one that’s equally vital to anyone and everyone regardless of identity group. It’s a great movie and fuck you for denying it to your kids.> Disney cartoons are not supposed to teach your teach life lessonsThe best ones do teach you life lessons, they just do it subtly and archetypally, almost unconsciously, subject to interpretation (well okay Zootopia’s aggressively unsubtle but it’s still very thoughtful about its subject matter and is still chiefly telling a story first before teaching a lesson).

"> If you support the movement that is currently holding sway among the ""populist"" right wing - eg Trump fans, the ""alt right""/ ""alt lite"", popular online right-wing/anti-progressive commentators eg Milo, Cernovich, Coulter, the Proud Boy movement - then you are inevitably throwing your hat in with the ""religious right"". It's those people and their supporters that have brought about the state of affairs we have today. And you may call yourself a liberal, or a libertarian, or even a ""non-political person who just wants to play games"" - but by standing in the way of liberalism and progressivism you are enabling those people, and ultimately taking their side in the debate.Divide and conquer tactics. Not only that but you're completely inaccurate. The alt-lite, and even the alt-right, habitually go out of their way to transgress and shock the sensibilities of the religious right. Milo has openly rejected the religious right and is himself flamboyantly gay and married to a man, he's spoken about how he was a fan of Marilyn Manson back during the previous culture war, etc. Much of the alt-right is pro-abortion, some of it (including Richard Spencer himself) is accepting of gay people, and the entire alt-right worldview is incompatible with Conservative Christianity as it exists in the USA (the alt-right being rather anti-semitic whilst conservative Christians are philo-semitic).Not to mention, *conservative Christianity is in both political and demographic decline*. Younger evangelicals, by the way, are less anti-gay than their elders, so the ""conservative Christians"" are being less conservative every day. Your package-dealing of ""liberalism and progressivism"" is outright wrong on every level.>Is it really ""classist"" to disagree with someone because you don't think they are educated enough to understand what they're talking about? Its classist to immediately dismiss them as racist because they don't use sufficiently eloquent terminology. You should at least try exercising interpretive charity. >The basic fundamentals of the issue are not complex, you don't need a college degree in sociology or theology to understand the principles. Tommy isn't conventionally educated but he isn't stupid, he knows what he is doing. Hence my phrase ""weasel words"".Would you consider Douglas Murray racist then? Or bigoted? What about Bruce Bawer? Because I don't see them making substantially different arguments, they just use more educated language to do so. >I don't believe it is unfathomable bigotry. As a liberal progressive, I am quite happy to say that I think a lot of the principles of fundamentalist Islam are utterly abhorrent, and incompatible with modern, liberal society and values. I know for a fact all of my liberal progressive friends would say the same thing.Then why do Sam Harris and Richard Dawkins... both broadly-speaking on the left... get accused of bigotry for saying *precisely that*? What about Bill Maher?You *know* this happens.>What left wing/progressives take issue with, is right wing political views which imply that ALL Muslims agree with those horrible and totalitarian ideals, and in particular with those that try to say that this ""fact"" means that Muslims shouldn't be in western / non-Islamic countries.Apart from Pamela Geller and perhaps Milo, I don't know anyone who says this. Douglas Murray doesn't. Tommy Robinson doesn't. Harris and Dawkins don't. Christopher Hitchens never did. Maajid Nawaz doesn't (indeed, he's a Muslim). Ayaan Hirsi Ali doesn't (and she specifically repudiates such positions in her book *Heretic*). Almost all of these figures have been accused of ""racism"" and ""islamophobia"" however, by certain people on the left.>But you just need to go and look at comments on, say, Breitbart articlesYes, comments on Breitbart articles are a fucking dumpster fire. But its exceptionally unlikely that *comments on Breitbart articles* will become the guiding lights of policy within the West. You know those people are exceptionally fringe.>the viewpoint that they should be entirely barred from the west (or indeed wiped from the face of the Earth altogether) is fairly established and unchallenged amongst the ""right"".As someone who's been a libertarian for decades, has spoken with people from the left and the right, the idea that there should be a *blanket ban on all Islamic immigration into the west* is *anything but* accepted orthodoxy on the right. At most, I see arguments for civic values tests, enhanced screenings for links to terrorism, and in some cases temporary quantity caps or temporary pauses. And are you *fucking kidding me* about the idea that ""wiping Muslims off the face of the earth"" is somehow accepted orthodoxy on the right?!? *Libertarians, Paleoconservatives and Trumpists are all less interventionist than Neoconservatives* so that's even *less* likely to happen. One or two ranters on *Breitbart* says nothing about actual policy platforms. >I am open minded enough to be able to see that there are elements of totalitarianist thought on the left - due to the fact that at the end of the day, society needs laws, to some extent, in order to function, and laws inevitably boil down to rights being restricted and freedoms being impinged.That's not an open-minded viewpoint at all. Its a phony attempt at balance and you know it. The proper role of law is to *ensure* rights by prohibiting the *violation* of them. There is no ""right to murder"" and thus laws against murder do not violate anyone's rights. Yes, society needs laws, but that's a vacuous truth. You're ignoring the absurdly long history of totalitarianism on the left; every form of Marx-inspired ideology degenerated into totalitarianism. 20s/30s/40s progressivism, an ideology of the left, was essentially fascism with pseudoscientific pretentions. Auguste Comte was hardly a right-winger and his philosophy has been absurdly influential on the technocratic left; Comte was a devout totalitarian. >However in my opinion the extent of the left's totalitarianism extends to limiting people's absolute freedom of speech, when that speech has the potential to incite hate or harm against others. ""Incite"" has a very particular meaning in law. It requires the advocacy of imminent lawless conduct. The left's proposed limitations on freedom of speech are much, much broader and include even books like Charles Murray's *The Bell Curve* (which is controversial but hardly inciteful). >The extent of totalitarianism proposed by the right - no abortions, no homosexualityBullshit. Again, there are libertarians (mostly pro-abortion, universally accepting of private sexual conduct), many of the populist-nationalist parties are pro-choice (for example Pauline Hanson's One Nation party in Australia... Hanson supports abortion on request), and the gay marriage issue is basically settled. The upcoming generation of Evangelical Christians are not only less numerous than the last, but also more accepting on gay marriage.>from comments on right wing outlets like BB its undeniable that many have these viewsAnd these people aren't making the policy. Hell, they're more extreme than Breitbart's own writers.-----Your entire screed is nothing more than an attempt to deny the fact that the culture war has radically changed. You're still pretending that there are radical dominionists in the wings, when the reality is that the contemporary right has become substantially more secular and in some ways much more socially liberal than it used to be. As even Angela Nagle... an old leftist and author of *Kill All Normies* pointed out... the Alt-Right (and she was talking about the *actual* Alt-Right, not people like Sargon of Akkad) is a right wing completely devoid of Christian morality.Trying to wave 90s-era culture war flags makes no sense in today's world.

"I'm sure you'll find at least one of these websites reliable.[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunglasses#Modern_developments):>In the early 1920s, the use of sunglasses started to become more widespread, especially among movie stars. Inexpensive mass-produced sunglasses made from celluloid were first produced by Sam Foster in 1929. Foster found a ready market on the beaches of Atlantic City, New Jersey, where he began selling sunglasses under the name Foster Grant from a Woolworth on the Boardwalk. By 1938, *Life* magazine wrote of how sunglasses were a ""new fad for wear on city streets ... a favorite affectation of thousands of women all over the U.S."" It stated that 20 million sunglasses were sold in the United States in 1937, but estimated that only about 25% of American wearers needed them to protect their eyes.[Zenni Optical](https://www.zennioptical.com/blog/the-history-of-sunglasses-the-journey-from-function-to-fashion/):>It wasn’t until the mid 20th century when sunnies really started to be used as we they are today. This is mainly thanks to Sam Foster, founder of Foster Grants, and Hollywood. In 1929, Foster sold inexpensive, mass-produced frames made specifically to protect people’s eyes from the sun on the beaches of the Atlantic City Boardwalk. Around this time, sunglasses were also beginning to be used widely among actresses, to hide from the paparazzi, and to cover their red eyes brought on from the powerful arc lamps needed for the low speed film stocks.[StartUp FASHION](https://startupfashion.com/fashion-archives-a-look-at-the-history-of-sunglasses/):>At the start of the century, they were a favorite accessory among movie stars. For actresses, they served two practical purposes. First, glasses helped celebrities disguise themselves from fans. Additionally, the lights used back then on film sets and in cameras were extremely powerful and harsh- flashbulbs even contained magnesium. Paparazzi flash was literally blinding, and often caused actresses to frequently suffer from red, watery eyes. To avoid being photographed or having to greet fans in this state, dark glasses were essential. Tinted lenses helped to alleviate and hide the symptoms.>While these glasses were initially worn for practical purposes, the fact that they were worn by glamorous actresses gave them a celebrity appeal. At the end of the 1920’s, sunglasses became a full-blown fashion accessory.",0.0

In fact, one of the few times they actually censored something was bestiality-related as that's apparently riskier to bring over, and this was in a VN that had loli incest completely intact. ",1.0

">That you willingly subsume yourself to help an ideology that hates you and wants you dead is troubling, to say the least. Take care of yourself, you deserve better.Just another example of muddled (or perhaps just lack of) thinking on the subject. Ideologies don't ""want people dead"". They aren't conscious beings with ""wants"". Perhaps that's all that's going on here - you haven't really thought about this at all properly, you just don't like all those serious women making points about society/gender issues when you just want to play games. And somewhere along the line you've picked up the idea that there's an ""ideology"" out there called feminism, and somehow it is sentient and wants you dead. If that's it, then fine - I completely see what the issue is here. I don't agree with the way you see the world, but I respect your right to express your opinion about it here. And we can leave it at that. Perhaps it's more than that though - maybe that statement was just your somewhat clumsy attempt at saying that ""the people who believe in this ideology want me (all men, I presume) dead"". In which case I have to take issue. First you would have to define what you meant by ""the people who believe in this ideology."" Presumably - you mean feminists. But what do you mean by a feminist? Because I've already given my definition (which happens to match with the dictionary definition, and just about every online definition I can find) that a feminist is someone who believes men and women deserve to be treated equally in society. But I assume you have a different definition, as that doesn't seem to match with the idea of them hating me and wanting me dead. Most of the people I know in real life are feminists. My family all call themselves feminists. Most of the people who I admire in public life, I either know are feminists because they have said so, or I can infer from their words and actions that they live by feminist principles (working towards a society where everyone has equal rights). I asked one of my niece's 18 year old friends the other day if she considered herself a feminist. She's never heard me talk about gender issues and I've never called myself a feminist in front of her. Her immediate answer was, ""Well, like, yeah, of course I am..."" followed by looking at me like it would be stupid to assume anything else. I was heartened by that, as some of the stuff I'd been reading online (generally all from anti-feminist sources, like this sub, for example) had made me think that perhaps it wasn't such an obvious question these days for a lot of people. Anyway I'm rambling a bit, but my point is, these people don't want me killed, and they don't hate me. Maybe there are some very fringe, radical feminists with a genuine, non-ironic ""kill all men"" outlook, but I've never, ever , in 40 years of moving amongst people who in the vast majority of cases call themselves feminist, met a single one.

"You know what annoys me about this. It's not the weird ""not oppressed enough"" vibe, it's that their argument doesn't actually make sense.So they start with a number of LGBT individuals saying how they're ""just like you"". They also have a bunch of other unrelated traits that SJWs don't like, just to make sure that you know to hate them.Then they present a bunch of supposed counter-examples to the idea that pushing ""we're just like you"" is bad, but their counter-examples are nonsensical.1. A woman complaining that she accused of having kids for welfare. I assume because she's black. I was under the impression that the 'B' in LGBT stood for 'bisexual', not 'black', shows what I know!2. A woman complaining about being harassed and arrested on the suspicion of being a sex worker. It's not clear why from the avatar though, but I'm guessing she's supposed to be South-East Asian? Either way, I'm not sure what the point is. Racism is bad, but what does that have to do with LGBT people?3. Homeless woman(?) complains that their sexuality bars them from shelters. Giving them the benefit of the doubt that this is a real problem, it is actually relevant. What I'm failing to see is how that demonstrates a problem with ""just like you"" messaging. Surely if the people running these shelters understood that being gay wasn't really a big deal, they'd let this person in. Also this homeless woman has autism, that isn't actually relevant, but they pretend it is.4. Immigrant from ???, at least that's what I assume. Ignoring the weird ""gender variant culture"" stuff, I'm not really sure what the issue is here, again. Colonialism was bad. Racism against immigrants is also bad. How is this an LGBT issue?5. Victim of the War on Drugs. I'm guessing orphaned after the Houston Heroin Bombings of 2004. Seriously though, the war of drugs is bad and has had a lot of collateral damage. Again, how is this an LGBT issue?6. Wheelchair user complaining about the world being inaccessible to them. Fair enough, I guess. I'm not physically disabled, so I don't know how bad it is for them, but it doesn't matter because it's *not an LGBT issue*.So 6 examples and only one is clearly relevant (and even then includes some irrelevant stuff).

On one hand, I kinda get why they do this because it's a legal issue. The age of the two main characters here are 16 and 15 and this, **correct me if I'm wrong here**, is considered child porn. Although The UK age of consent is 16, The specific issue is that a 16 year old legal is having sexual relations with a 15 year old who is still a “child”, a legal-on-nonlegal depiction. Understandable that they would not want to stick their 2-inch pole in this deep, troublesome hole. On the other hand, the real issue lies with the stupid laws and provisions that are in place. They are drawings. Fictional characters. They are not real ~~just like your waifus~~.Existing for as long as they're drawn. Just because a creator of a work has labelled characters a certain age that should not mean anything. The laws in UK and the general populace mindset regarding this thing need to change as they still treat drawings as having the same rights as a living, breathing, normal people. But these are just my 2 cents.Anyway, thoughts?",1.0

">One of the trio’s hoax papers, published in April by the journal Fat Studies, claims bodybuilding is “fat-exclusionary” and proposes “a new classification . . . termed fat bodybuilding, as a fat-inclusive politicized performance.” Editor Esther Rothblum said the paper had gone through peer review, and the author signed a copyright form verifying authorship of the article. “This author put a lot of work into this topic,” she said. “It is an interesting topic, looking at weight and bodybuilding. So I am surprised that, of all things, they’d write this as a hoax.

"Batman use to kill under Bob Kane until the early 40s when the PTA fainting couch types said ""Superhoes shouldn't kill"". He originally was written to leave KGBeast to die in the tunnels after their fight in 1988 (Batman #420), it's only later retconning by another writer that says KGBeast was later rescued. And in Batman 425 he allows a mobster to be crushed by a pile of car. So Yeah I don't see a difference.Now as to the idea ""it'd practically not the same character"" it kind of isn't, if you read venom now, he's got very little hatred or love for spider-man it is almost understood as a ""you leave me alone, I leave you alone"" which started in lethal protector where Venom actually upholds a deal not be a jackass and be a hero in the west coast if Spider-man leaves him alone. The villainous venom you're thinking of is similar to how Bob Kane originally wrote  batman, it was there it exist but isn't the character how he has been for 25  of the 30 years he's existed, that villainous ""WE HATE SPIDER-MAN SO MUCH"" venom is actually minority of the stories for him.Read ""Edge of the Venomverse"" it specifically explores ""what if alternate versions of other heroes got the symboite"" witout it touching peter as far as the story says.",0.0

"It doesn't matter whether the cop is right or not. How. Can. You. Be. So. Dense. Even if the cop is wrong, you do what they say. Even if they're wrong, you don't abuse them. You're deduction that i must think the cop is always right because i would be mad at my family for disrespecting and abusing an officer is so far fetched i don't even want to read the rest of the comment. Something is wrong with your perception of logic. Yes i don't know if they did anything wrong or not, this is not related to my reaction to them abusing an officer though. You say ""it tells me"" so fucking often, in every comment you assume what i think, every single time wrongly. I keep repeating that you're making an enemy in your heard and play the victim, but it doesn't get through to you. And then you have the audacity to tell me I'm putting words in YOUR mouth, get a grip come on. It doesn't matter what the fuck you've done, it can be fucking nothing. If you don't attack the Dutch police they won't attack you, it's that easy. Of course the beating is warrented if they ATTACKED THE COP FIRST. Which this entire thing is about. If there is absolute no context fuck yeah I'm picking the cops side, they are highly respected members of society like i mentioned fucking hours ago. Of course they can be wrong, but that doesn't mean I'm not assuming they're not with good reason. Funny how you try to get out of a losing argument by saying i should pretend there's no context and make it about the completely irrelevant statement ""cops are always right"" , as this is about a video where there is clear context and the cop is clearly in the right. But to answer that specific question of yours: if i walk in a room, no context, and i see my family member assault an officer with no context what so ever, just like the video, and the cop retaliates, i am 100 percent picking the side of the law. I've been stating this over and over again and the fact that you think i shoot myself in the foot by saying this and claim the cop is always right (which additionally is completely irrelevant to the argument anyway) there's something wrong with your comprehension. ""doesn't matter how. Insignificant the offense"" the offense is assaulting an officer of the law you dense idiot, that's what it's been about the entire time.

"Of course we do.>In the early-to-mid 20th century, the phrase ""politically correct"" was used to describe strict adherence to a range of ideological orthodoxies. In 1934, The New York Times reported that Nazi Germany was granting reporting permits ""only to pure 'Aryans' whose opinions are politically correct.""[2]>As Marxist-Leninist movements gained political power, the phrase came to be associated with accusations of dogmatic application of doctrine, in debates between American Communists and American Socialists. This usage referred to the Communist party line which, in the eyes of the Socialists, provided ""correct"" positions on all political matters. That is the history and that is how it is implemented today. Regardless of attempts to ~~redefine~~ mask the function, that is what it is at root.Over-reaching collective orthodoxy is *always* a problem, always oppressive.Doesn't really matter if the garnish is religious or ""secular"", it's still saturated in emotional beliefs rather than objective facts, and that's why it is described as pseudo-religion.  It follows the same social mechanics, the fervor, the ostracization of non-believers, the denial of objective facts for the purposes of The Party, the substitution of science with rationalizations, the same manipulations of brow beating or guilt-tripping or other forms of shaming.This is one end of [PC culture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZUPsGDFZzVM) as an example of how bad it can get. *Abject* science denialism, rejecting dissent with manipulations according to PC ""rules"".If science is ""oppressive"" then your views are not in line with reality whatsoever.Admittedly, a lot of these people are marginalized.  It's just not for the reasons they claim(skin, genitals, etc).  It is because they are pants on head retarded.  It's that they think being ""politically correct"" has any basis in reality over being *factually correct.*  For this reason, there are some times when marginalization is called for.  Same reason we marginalize other stupid ideas or ideologies which have the end result of being objectively bad for society(the intent is irrelevant).Why is intent irrelevant?  Because good intent often has ridiculously bad results.  Contrary to what these mental midgets learned in early life, it's not just ""the thought that counts"".  It's the *impact*.There's nothing but good intent behind most anti-vaxxers.  They don't set out to breath new life into virtually extinct diseases, but it is a very real potential impact of their suggested plan.  Nobody really thinks they're the bad guy( barring socipaths/psychopahs and the like, as well as some epiphany about how they've made stupid decisions that got them into the situation they're in...Why?  these are statistical outliers).""The greatest trick the devil ever pulled was convincing people that he didn't exist"" bears some merit in this case, and I say this even as an atheist.  People too unintelligent to know they're a danger to themselves and others, or those that know and successfully hide it behind platitudes and lip-service that sounds good to a casual observer...""Political correctness"" is one such term, as is ""Social Justice"" and a wide variety of language of leftist orthodoxy buzzwords.",1.0

"No, it's really not. Here's what happened (speaking as someone on the left). I think about a decade or so ago, things were by and large much more liberal. People were focused on more individual level diversity, breaking down expectations placed on people, letting people choose their own path in life. That sort of thing. (As an example, universal health care is touted as making it easier for people to open up businesses). But over the last decade or so, things have changed. I think the left has moved away from being liberal, and is now more progressive. And there IS a distinct difference. The former is about freedom and choice and individuality, and the latter is about results and statistics and ratios. Now, I don't think that's permanent. I think a big part of that is because progressivism (especially something like Critical Theory) plays VERY well in 140 (now 280, but the same idea goes) characters. And a LOT of effort goes into covering up the idea that there's ""two lefts"". Including, I might add, the opposition to GamerGate. Liberalism and Progressivism are simply not the same thing. They don't go together at all. Now, there might be some similarities, but where they're coming from and how to get there tend to be entirely different. ",0.0

As a self-conscious teenager, if the game-making excitement had been nurtured a bit earlier I think I would have started making games sooner. You need some kind of aspirational figure, or someone who's excited about the prospect of it - or at least, that's what I needed and I didn't have it. It was only recently when I became a bit jaded about working in TV and film that I realised games was what I really in my gut wanted to do.""Are there aspirational male developers for guys to look up to? Do all male game devs go into the industry looking up to and trying to become living meme Todd Howard? Reading through this it seems like this person is needlessly gendering the first issue they bring up, in reality I don't think that there are any significant paragon developer figures we can all look up to. More than that, if you're citing a group of career advisors who likely have no experience with gaming but watch TV and movies like it's a religion, no wonder they aren't advising that you go into games. It may even be coming from a place of love, they see TV and movie people making millions, but couldn't even name a development studio, let alone specific dev.Then, of course, the gamedrop:>""A lot of the challenges come from the online space. When things like Gamergate bleed into the mainstream consciousness, it's not going to do much to reinform the public or aspiring developers about what the industry is like,"" she says. ""And that's a shame because I really have met so many creative and progressive individuals and organisations from my short time in the games industry.""Her direct quote is interesting, a generous interpretation may hold that she regrets what the media made of GG, because she's met supportive and nice people on the inside. Her later quotes argue for greater representation, but do so in a relatively sane way, so it could be.The article goes into her game a bit. It is evidently ten minutes long, but is a homage/reference to the games Ico and Inside, the film Paths of Glory, and the German TV show Generation of War? How do you manage that many references/influences in a ten minute game?Some literal objectification:>The unconscious character is central to a concept Fernandez was interested in: creating an emotional attachment between the player and the 'tool' used to solve puzzles (in this case, a human body).She shows some remarkable sanity regarding how she thinks greater representation should be achieved:>""One thing that I really want to stress is that I don't think the solution is to police or censor violent or sexual depictions of women in games. To me, it's about creating a bigger variety of female representations instead of just repeatedly falling back on character tropes. It's in everyone's best interest. We'll have far more interesting games as a result.Again, a generous interpretation would be that she wants to make her own games with new female characters, our brothers-in-arms over at r/WerthamInAction will appreciate that approach I think.Then some light-to-middling misrepresentation of the facts regarding the Battlefield V fiasco, and this gem:>""It's intimidating,"" she admits, ""but it's more important to me to make stories I'm interested in with characters I'm interested in, rather than fear this imaginary audience who will probably troll me online at some point in my career anyway.The author of the article is kinda bad, but the dev depicted seems to have her head/PR game on straight.",1.0

"So, ever the contrarian, I actually think the study is pretty good. I have plenty of things I disagree with, but it's clearly written with pretty honest analysis. I did manage to find a false positive listed as a Russian troll, but to be fair the guy was buying retweets and later deleted his channel and renamed his twitter, so it would have been easy to drop that account through the cracks.The biggest thing that I want to draw attention to is that the researcher has repeatedly expressed disappointment that anyone focusing on ""muh Russian Trolls"" is completely missing the point of the study, which details how the bots are a tiny fraction of a fraction, and that most of them have since been purged by twitter.In reference to https://www.cnet.com/au/news/actually-half-of-the-last-jedi-haters-were-not-russian-trolls/ he says ""This one gets it right."" http://archive.is/G5QcyHere's an excerpt from that article:>None of that is to say this was Bay's intention. The 38 page research paper explains his methodology in-depth and with great clarity. He draws conclusions based on the dataset he has acquired and even states that it has ""limitations"" and the study is of a ""less-than-comprehensive nature"". In his conclusion, he remarks that the assertions made within his paper must be considered only within the ""limited scope of the data set"".>He knows that makes for a less exciting story.>""Having worked as a journalist for many years, I know how the game works,"" he explains.>Bay is ""moderately disappointed in some of the major media brands"" that ran articles without taking the time to get a little deeper. He understands that some of his findings were buried because they produce a less enticing lede than ""Russian Troll Army invading the Star Wars galaxy."">That's just not what his research suggests.>""The suspected Russian trolls are so few that it is basically the normal amount of Russian trolls you would expect to be present in a high-profile online debate.""And now for some tweets:>I don't come to that conclusion at all.**Some journalists have wrongly extracted that from the paper**. The paper just shows that there is deliberate politicization happening, i.e. people are inserting partisan politics into Star Wars discussions now for different reasons. http://archive.is/rMpzB>Very true. But having worked as a journalist for many years myself, I know the game. ""Russian trolls invade Star Wars galaxy"" is much more fun than ""Angry alt-righters use Star Wars fan discussion to vent political viewpoints"". Or ""On social meda, people are political"" 😀 http://archive.is/Tu30l>Absolutely. That's the real question, isn't it? And **if everyone could stop focusing on the tiny detail about Russian trolls in the paper**, they would find at least a partial answer in it: People fanning the flames for political reasons, even in SW discourse. http://archive.is/cgYcP>**With all due respect to the journalist, the study actually says the opposite. There's only a small number of bots**, but an interesting number of trolls, and a lot of people with a political agenda. Also, I graduated, thanks 😁.http://archive.is/nOOUd>That has nothing to with it. Russian trolls are everywhere, they insert themselves in discussions all over the Internet and have done so for years. Star Wars fandom is just another venue. The paper is on deliberate politicization of fandom in general, not just Russian efforts. http://archive.is/gQ3Eu>Read the paper. That's not what it says. **Suspected Russian trolls are a tiny group within a larger one**. The Russian troll activities target anything where disruption can be made.

"Im  just hung up on the beating being warranted in any way, shape or form. It doesn’t de-escalate the situation at all. Its essentially senseless considering the means with which the police have to apprehend people. And, if its not senseless then its inefficient. The cop could tackle the lady, the other cops would swarm her, over power her, and have her in a squad car before the video is even over. But fine. Maybe its a cultural disconnect, like you said. You always side with police no matter what, and I always side with not beating people for not much of a reason other than to hit back for the sake of hitting back. Just because someone hits you, it doesn’t mean you hit them back. Is it within the cops right? Absolutely. Again, that doesn’t mean he should do it. Look at the size of the cop compared to her. She is treated like a rag-doll when he handled her. Instead of doing all of that, making a huge fuss, causing people to run, the cop could have capped it and ended it there by tackling her to the ground, and cuffing her. And look, the woman is completely at fault. She deserves her punishment in a court— or however you do it in holland. She deserves her time, and that, I believe, is justice. The root of that fuss is obviously coming from her, she is the biggest factor in the fuss. The thing is, the cops contribute to the fuss. If it was up to me, that would not be an officer’s purpose. You try your best not to contribute violence in a situation when you don’t need to and the officer really did need to at all. If you think he did, I still need you to rationally explain how a drunk lady can do more than a black eye on a cop. If she had a weapon, you would think she would have drawn it after a punch or two. But she didn’t, so maybe at that point you stop punching her and just cuff her. Then again, maybe not. You guys handle your women however you want, I guess. I won’t tell you what to, and what not to do with them. The base of my argument is that I just believe the police can, and should do better than that. They shouldn’t have to beat people in order to get them to comply. Its not their job to injure criminals, its their job to apprehend them.  The only times I feel it IS warranted is life or death situations, riots, or a raid. But, presumably you raid with guns, so I don’t know why there would be a beating involved. But I digress. Finally, I guess I’ll apologize. I get a little emotional when I get in a “political” debate. Maybe it really is just cause we’re from different parts of the world. ",0.0

You'll need loads of proof that you were innocent of the crime that he was arresting you for, but yeah, unlawful arrest is hella illegal and there are a lot of legal precedents where people legally killed cops that were illegally arresting them.A lot of people have a deep-seeded love affair with cops though, so they'll tell you that you *have to* comply with any order that a cop ever makes of you. Those people are wrong. You can not only fight off a cop that is illegally arresting you, you can murder a cop that is illegally arresting someone else too. That is what the US Supreme Court has ruled. http://www.constitution.org/uslaw/defunlaw.htmIn your specific example about being confused with a burglar, however, it would probably be ruled these days that the cops had ""reasonable suspicion"" to arrest you; which is basically a catch-all for any and all behavior that a cop wants to do. So the real question is: how much of the law will a cop/judge bend in order to protect themselves in the event of an unlawful arrest? The answer is: a lot. A lot of the law will be bent and even broken in order to protect a cop that commits an unlawful arrest, so you therefore would likely not be able to exercise your *right* to defend yourself from cops. Kinda scary.There are a plenty of cases though, even recently, where people are found innocent of murdering an unlawful cop... but most of those people still spent time in jail, and were even badly beaten by other police (see the Ray Rosas case), so you'll probably still miss your flight... but there was a guy that killed a cop in self defense then evaded other cops for 6 days and was still found not guilty, so who knows, you might be able to catch that flight after all.It's a very imperfect system, and anyone that you find defending it is usually incompetently ignorant of it and has a Just-World Fallacy and thinks that all cops are good guys and they only ever catch bad guys... or they are a cop themselves, and they benefit greatly from this fascist shit show.",0.0

"Despite having a trans girlfriend, I’ve been lurking meta since I discovered it this spring. I generally agree with most of the viewpoints of the posters here, from gun control, the insanity of the left, the anti illegal immigration sentiments, JT, Pro Bernier, affirmative action, etc. Even on a lot of the trans issues; regardless of how I feel about my gf, i totally get how it’s weird to most people, and I frankly have no issue if you want to call her a man. I mean, it’s an asshole move and lacks grace if you do it to a person’s face, but I won’t hate you for it, I get it (I’m a huge Shapiro fan, and he does not mince words on the subject). Im Pro Jordan Peterson (as is my trans gf)But I will guess that most of the “hate” towards trans people on meta is coming from people who have never actually met or had a conversation with a trans person. Like any segment, there are crazies, and likely a higher percentage than in gen pop, sure. But calling trans people mentally retarded and saying they can’t do a job that has nothing to do with their gender really is pure hate. I would never say you folks don’t have the right to say it, I’m a free speech absolutist, but you do nothing but hurt your side of the political spectrum. Yes, the left is filled with hate at the moment, but you are just continuing the cycle and turning away folks like me who are on board with most things that the PPC party champions. It’s fine to have your opinion, but to have that much hate for people (CANADIANS) you have never met is telling more of you than of them. Not all trans folks are activists trying to change our society, most I have met are actually the opposite; opposed to the activism, they don’t want that spotlight, they just want to lead normal lives. There currently isn’t any drug/therapy that helps trans people as much as actually transitioning does, until that time this is in a lot of cases the best course of action for a happier life.I would also like to note, that not all trans people are actually legit gender dysmorphic, I have met a few that are straight up flaming gay dudes that took it too far. You know what that means, being able to tread that line?It’s called nuance, something sorely lacking on both sides. I hate the crazy left, but the vitriol from some here is just as bad. Nay, it’s worse. The left can at least claim their insanity is out of « feelings » and « justice » and « equality ». All you folks have is hateTo the bigots on here",1.0

">I’ve decided not to cut corners. So, join me, with due diligence and civic duty, and publicly claim: I am sexist!It's always the same shit from male feminists: collective blame to alleviate the weight on their own consciences. It's a common coping mechanism. The man who authored this is in a grey zone where he's clearly a bad person, but still has strong enough of a conscience to recognize his behavior as shitty. This puts him in an awkward predicament where he'll treat people like garbage and then feel bad about it later. So he does the typical and states the problem isn't with *him*, but with *men in general*. You see, now it's suddenly not his fault. He now suddenly feels a whole lot better about himself. The best part is he didn't even really admit to any wrongdoing. Remember: it's not actually his fault. It's society's fault! >I speak as an insider. I know about what so many of us men think about women — the language we use, the sense of power that we garner through our sexual exploits, our catcalling and threatening, our sexually objectifying gazes, our dehumanizing and despicable sexual gestures and our pornographic imaginations. This is not simply locker room banter but a public display of unchecked bravado for which we often feel no shame.He loudly proclaims, shouting through cupped hands on a rooftop, that the feminists were right all along! Men *are* sexist, and he's willing to tell them what happens behind closed doors. He's on their side. Feminists cheer in unison because that's what they really wanted. A good male ally doesn't talk about how the overwhelming majority of men are decent people. A good male ally tells women that every inching suspicion they had about men was true all along. >Since the world is watching, we, as men, need to join in the dialogue in ways that we have failed to in the past. We need to admit our roles in the larger problem of male violence against women. We need to tell the truth about ourselves.He urges other men to act. He tells other men that they too are responsible, and that they too need to share the blame. He martyrs himself in the least committed and most half-assed way possible, and then tells us all how great he is for it. He tells other men that he, a woke male ally, is what all men should strive to be. Yeah. He's not the first male feminist with this M.O. to come out of the woodwork and attempt to shine the light on men. Just once I want to see a male feminist *actually* admit to what it is that's weighing him down so much. The fact that he keeps repeating ""men are all like this, but *I'm* different"" raises an eyebrow. Please, George. Speak for yourself. I'm not any of the things you described in the article.

(This is ignoring that we find a distinct overlap in things like consensual incestuous behaviour and things like narcissistic personality disorder, where we find one we often find the other, but whatever right?)Also people just don't work on facts. Why is Trump in office? Well, primarily he's in office because his opponent was Hillary Clinton. (Literally anyone else would have fucked him to death on election day.) But at least 40% of the reason he's in office is the emotions of his voters.Alright bad example. Better one, Why do people shoot people who break into their homes? 90% of people breaking into your house just want your TV. This is not a problem that requires lethal force. So why do home invaders get shot? Because the guy holding the gun is scared of the potential fact that the home invader *doesn't* just want his TV. Even though statistically that's most likely *just* not the case. So yeah, it's great that Destiny can just fling statistics. Even better that he has that kind of brain that can actually recall statistics. I don't think hes ever been caught being wrong about a statistic. But he's arguing from very much the wrong place.

The PRC is a work in progress, but we hold the high cards, especially with our economy doing pretty well now that the government's boot is not pressing down quite so hard on its neck.From the way he's clearly negotiating things, it seems like most of that is bluster and he can come down to something more reasonable. I highly doubt he'd do anything to legitimately hurt Canada.>and current suppression of their fossil fuels industries. When it comes to the energy sector my primary concern is fusion. I know people who've been working on it at different stages and it's absolutely legit. Each of the testing nations (US, China, France, Germany, UK, Japan,... Lockheed?), is building their own different procedures to try and find the most efficient and sustainable process for ignition. They've already achieved ignition on small scales. The Trump administration has been *very* tight with research funding, but that shit is not something to limit. Leave that alone so we can not only dominate the energy sector through fossil fuel production, but also through technology.> But I'm pretty sure he knew what he was getting himself into.

I never said or suggested anything of the sort. I said you're wrong to use the wrong word and should instead use a different one.After all, each of these events are indeed killings.

"This disgusting piece of trailer trash tried to gain sympathy by sobbing to any media outlet that would listen to her. Last I heard, she also was going to try to sue but that didn't work out for her once the footage came to light. She had released a very limited version (what one of her friends filmed during this arrest) to the internet around June/July, but when the rest of the footage was leaked she looked like an asshole.The reason she didn't want to give her name? She was already on probation for something she did a year or so before, and knew that she wasn't supposed to be drinking because 1) She's underage and 2) It's illegal to have an open container on most beaches in the NY/NJ area. If you're of age, there are people who drink but are smart enough to not get piss drunk and who don't leave it in an obvious container, neither of which this dimwit was smart enough to do.When it came to light that she was already on probation, a habitual liar (who started the fight), a single mom at 18-19 that kept referring to the father of her kid as ""baby daddy"" (media had reported that they were still together, they were not, so she apparently had to make that clear?) and an overall shitty human with terrible decision making skills, things didn't work out the way she wanted. The media outlets were trying to go for a more wholesome ""Random mother attacked in front of her child and family for no reason"" and when it turned out that none of it was true, the story kind of died off.

They also say they are an atheist, which combined with their radical views could indicate that they may want to discredit a religion by claiming something as simple as saying grace is a tool of the patriarchy(while not all atheists would care about something like this, her self-proclaimed status as a radical and her arguments seem to indicate that she is one of the more aggressive types of atheist). As such, they appear to have an ulterior motive, wanting the act of saying grace to have reasons that conform to their political and theological viewsBased on the flawed logic and their apparent political goals, it is not unfair to assume that they are not thinking logically about the act of praying before meals, but have simply decided that it must have something to do with the patriarchy, and then tried to come up with an argument to prove their point, resulting in an argument that is nonsensical.Basically, prayer is a square peg, the patriarchy is a round hole. They assumed that the square peg would fit in the hole without even looking at what shape the hole was, and then tried to force the square peg through even after they realised it wouldn't fit.",0.0

The left is reeling.  The left in America has a near religious worldview.  Everyone agrees with them.  They're so, soooo smart.  The smartest ever.  They're the party of good ideas and civil rights and that means that they have a monopoly on those issues.  And that means that everyone not them is the exact opposite -- Stoooooopid rednecks who hate everyone and will never amount to anything.  The US is fundamentally liberal and thanks to Obama, we've entered a liberal golden age and the GOP will have to spend the next 30 years out in the wilderness until they learn how to be DNC-lite....  Wait, what do you mean she lost?  Wait, it's Trump?  And he's doing a good job?  *And half the country agrees with him?*  That doesn't make any sense!  There MUST be something wrong with the country and reality itself, because lefties *can't be wrong.*  2. At the same time you have them having this mental breakdown due to the world refusing to confirm to their fantasies... You have their reaction being organized protest.  Heavily organized protest, to the point of being basically glorified mob actions.  And the way the left does this stuff is they synchronize the protests.  Very effective... but it makes it hard to ignore the fact that you're all synchronizing things.  Remember when we called them Snowflakes and they got pissed?  It touches on an unspoken assumption.  The lefties might all have the same beliefs and might all say the same things and might all be wearing the same pussy hats and might all be carrying the same professionally printed signs, but *they are all unique individuals* who happened to come upon these exact same ideas/phrases/talking points/etc because **they're just that smart.**  The NPC meme points out that, well, they're not getting all those ideas from their own galaxy sized brains.  They're getting them from, well, indirectly from Soros mostly, but from alpha lefties who hand them out.  The Rachel Maddows and the ShareBlues and the Media Matters of the world.  And on some level... they know this.  And it makes them feel really, REALLY uneasy.  3. Finally, you have the fact that the NPC meme is people mocking the left.  *Mocking.*  **The left.**  The left, which is comprised of the best of humanity.  The left, who are smarter than everyone else.  The left, who have the most perfect golden morality and ethics and beliefs.  ***How DARE you!?***  And yet... everyone is.So, a perfect storm - poking several deep seated insecurites the left has, all while laughing at those insecurities and their reaction to it all.

"I read about half of that one, down to defining and discussing what counts as a troll/sockpuppet.I have some concerns about ""sockpuppet"" not capturing people who are known by their handles correctly, but haven't read the underlying citations. For example, is ""DoubleLift"" or ""IceFrog"" technically defined as a sockpuppet? There's plenty of normies who have such a fundamental misunderstanding of our online culture that I can imagine people not understanding how these nicknames are tied more closely to a person's identity than a pseudonym or ""sockpuppet"" would account for. But, since I haven't read the underlying citations, I don't know. I am deeply suspicious about that definition, especially how frequently the author says they tweet.

"> I've read people insisting the Asians vs Harvard case isn't about Affirmative Action. Is that true?Not directly. Indirectly, the reason Asians suffer is because of affirmative action. Theoretically, you could ensure that only white people would suffer from affirmative action, but that would lead to such a decrease in the number of white people that people's eyebrows might start to go up. You can rest assured that the SJWs don't want their own children to have a close to zero chance of getting into top schools. So in practice, if Harvard loses, it's the end for affirmative action - at least in its current form. I am fairly optimistic now that King Kavanaugh is on the court.> In any case, if Affirmative Action is upheld, what about reverse Affirmative Action? Could employers look negatively on applicants who might have benefited from AA?Legally, no. In practice, they may try. This just ends up harming minorities who actually do have merit.

Hell, even our local LARP group team was POC-led (The DM above) and featured a number of gay and female players.This trend continued this after college and my table in the last 2 years has almost exclusively been women and gay men that are in love with the story telling.

"I'll copy/paste my [comment](https://reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/comments/9ohskg/journalism_ethics_do_not_be_fooled_by_the_recent/e7ual7w/?context=0):Yeah, that guy's annoying. From what I've seen, the article on it was accurate. In fact, I read more or less most of the report myself. Now, what's discussed in this video is this article: http://archive.fo/Q82pXWhich I've previously ignored (because I've read the source). At the time the story came out, they put out 4-5 articles (I don't get it either, so don't ask me), and this article has had all of... 371 comments. The article I've read, however, has - up to now - 14,101 comments: http://archive.fo/yovIUAnd it's accurate. As for what the person in video objects to, it's these parts of the article:> Page 14 of the document acknowledges that a few Silicon Valley tech giants now “control the majority of our conversations,” but that these platforms – including Google – must now break their initial promise to users of free speech and content neutrality.And this:> Google, argues the briefing, must move towards the European tradition and create “well-ordered spaces for safety and civility” rather than “unmediated marketplaces of ideas.”Personally, I'd first contact the person that wrote it. But, that's just me. Since the same person wrote several other articles as well. In the other article - the one which I read - it notes it accurately:> The briefing argues that Google, Facebook, YouTube and Twitter are caught between two incompatible positions, the “unmediated marketplace of ideas” vs. “well-ordered spaces for safety and civility.”> The first approach is described as a product of the “American tradition” which “prioritizes free speech for democracy, not civility.” The second is described as a product of the “European tradition,” which “favors dignity over liberty and civility over freedom.” The briefing claims that all tech platforms are now moving toward the European tradition.""Claims x is the case,"" obviously isn't the same as ""argues x should happen.""And:> The briefing associates Google’s new role as the guarantor of “civility” with the categories of “editor” and “publisher.”The only line I'm not sure would be this:> For example, the briefing argues that tech companies will have to censor their platforms if they want to “expand globally.”It does mention it once or twice, but I'm not sure I'd say ""argues."" For example:> “US-based IT monopolies are already tempted to compromise themselves in order to gain entrance to these vast and fast growing markets. The dictatorial leaders in these countries may be only too happy to collaborate with them since they want to improve their methods of control over their own populations and expand their power and influence in the United States and the rest of the world.”Another thing he objects to is ""Google admits."" I can see how it might be misleading, however I'd say it depends on whether or not the ""Insights Lab"" is from outside Google, which as another user notes it doesn't seem to be the case. If it is, then yeah, it's misleading. If not - and it might not be, because as the other user says there's the link that goes back to Google, and they do say it's ""internal research,"" then it's not necessarily misleading. Here's what Breitbart said on it in a recent article:> Perhaps they buy Google’s explanation that the presentation was just “research” and doesn’t reflect “official Google positions” — a  confusing explanation, as the research is about official Google positions. Is Google disagreeing with its own researchers’ assessment of where the company is headed?I'd have still suggested contacting the author of the article first, but eh.Also this: https://reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/comments/9ohskg/journalism_ethics_do_not_be_fooled_by_the_recent/e7uahed/",1.0

Summary: Rekieta Law goes through Lawyer Mark Zaid's extremely long motion to dismiss Richard Meyer's lawsuit against Mark Waid for tortious interference and defamation. Zaid claims Waid is not subject to Texas jurisdiction and does some extreme twisting of logic and words to reach that conclusion.The major hilarious points are1. Waid/Zaid claiming he has no business in Texas but he regularly attends conventions there and even offered to do business with the owner of Antarctic Press in exchange for them not publishing Meyer's comic book.2. Waid/Zaid claim that defamation was never done in Texas yet there is video/articles of Waid repeating his defaming points against Meyer at a convention in Texas.3. Waid/Zaid claim Waid did not initiate contact with Antractic Press. Waid's own Tweets and previous statement contradict this.4. Waid/Zaid claim Waid did not know Antarctic Press was located in Texas. Waid stated he knew the owners when he Tweeted he was calling them and called a Texas phone number.The lengthy livestream where Rekieta Law tears apart the motion and is in full rant mode can be found here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnTLB\_xU9N4&index=12&list=PLJdwBXWZFqz5\_7BI6iAA9HHjbc-LuY83D](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnTLB_xU9N4&index=12&list=PLJdwBXWZFqz5_7BI6iAA9HHjbc-LuY83D),1.0
"Human nature evolved over thousands of years. Meanwhile there's a lot of attempt to change it from ground-up in the last century or so. I don't think this attempt will survive evolution and it will die out as subspecies who don't subscribe to it will overtake those who do. E.g. vegans frequently overlap with people who have no kids for the sake of environment. Meanwhile rolling-coal-driving rednecks have multiple kids. Either rednecks will keep converting into child-free vegans forever or vegans will just die out and rednecks take over.> If rape were determined to be part of human nature, you wouldn't think it would be OK, would you?Unfortunately rape is part of any animals nature. Humans included. See outcome of many wars. WWII being the most recent and well studied example. People did acknowledge for as long that it's not good and actively fight against it as well. IMO that falls under fair competitiveness. Let's keep competing, but without shitty acts like this. Raping is sort of like gassing or bio weapons. It's so bad, we can agree to not use it and expect the other side to not use it on us.What stops us from making meat off-limit for all humans for the sake of fair competition? IMO it requires too much work to have fully sufficient diet. Some people are easier at that, some are worse off. Different people are subjected to different food over dozens of generations I guess?And BBQ is just one of the best dirty pleasures in life :)I'm all for reducing meat consumption though. No-meat-no-meal isn't exactly a healthy diet. But I don't think there's an objective way to curb. I hope evolution will kick in and over time it will normalise.> 'free-range' labels in a grocery store mean very littleThey do. Yes, some may use false advertising and double-speak.

"So just to be clear: About 10 million men and teenaged boys died fighting in WW1.  The majority of these men didn't have the right to vote, because suffrage in Europe was contingent on property ownership, and most working class men didn't own enough property to be enfranchised.  The mountains upon mountains of straight white male corpses propelled the universal suffrage movement to the forefront.  Women achieved the vote upon mountains of dead males, both in Europe and the US (see: civil war).   Not a single woman had to actually fight for suffrage.  She suffered no real risk.  She just had to complain to the men in power.   And the ""patriarchs"" in government gave women the vote with no conscription obligations (that's not equality, that's chivalry) as soon as the majority said they wanted it.  These men and boys, who suffered some of the worst deaths humanly imaginable -- having their guts blown out in trenches and inhaling poison gas, being eaten alive by rats while crucified on barbed wire -- were ""privileged"", according to feminists.   A sizable percentage of feminists from the time period actually encouraged men and boys -- who again couldn't vote -- to go die for them in the trenches, to protect female ""honor"" (see white feather campaign).  While the suffragists demanded universal suffrage, the suffragettes wanted only rich white women and men to vote.   We celebrate the latter, not the former, because the former draw into question feminist mythology  [Edit: there were some women from the time period, often described as feminists or proto-feminists, who were consistent; eg the American anarchist Emma Goldman (whom I'm quite sure would be appalled by modern feminism) helped mount a legal challenge arguing that conscription was a violation of the 13th Amendment's prohibition against involuntary servitude.   The Supreme Court disagreed.   Ironically Goldman considered the suffragettes a bunch of spoiled brats, and famously claimed that ""if voting changed anything they'd make it illegal""]  Hundreds if not thousands of men were executed on the front lines to prevent desertion, even though historians now agree that many WWI campaigns were useless suicide missions, that the men knew it, and that the ""deserters"" were in the right not to throw their lives away for a patch of mud.  In the US, men were imprisoned, tortured and even executed for refusing to fight.   These included conscientious objectors from religious groups.   (two of these men, Hutterite brothers, were tortured to death at Alcatraz).  The majority of American men who fought in WWI were effectively forced to do so.   Far more Americans who fought in WWI were conscripted than volunteered.  Today, little rich girls who would be living in the gutter without the benefaction of their rich daddies, and living in caves without the benefaction of men as a group, condemn powerless white men and boys from a hundred years ago who died being eaten alive by rats while crying out for their mothers -- because they were white, and male.   Yes, this is a perfectly sane society, and feminism is a perfectly sane philosophy.   Moreover it encourages ""gender equality.""  Honestly, I don't feel hate.  I just feel shame and disgust.   Shame for what feminism has done to this society, and disgust for both the men and women who have allowed this to happen.    ",1.0

Same reason, except in their cases it's the cold winters that make them do this. Gotta have some way of preserving the vegetables. European cuisine traditionally didn't mix spices too much, it usually picked just one kind and added it a little bit to preserve the original flavor. Cultures like India added them in abundance, which resulted in an explosion of flavors. And honestly? Taste is subjective. It's just food. You eat it and then poop it out.

Because I feel that every single one of them, even if they didn't do any sexist thing to men or said any misandrist thing to them. We are all humans, men and women alike, we both can be sexist and hateful, we both have sexist assholes who can infiltrate a a good movement and turn it into a hate one.The difference between feminism and the MRM is that feminism is more than 100 years old, it appeared in the the late 19th century, but we as movement we are still relatively new compared to them.Unlike us, they have a lot of power and influence. The most we can have is some mysogynistic assholes who spout some sexist nonsense in an Internet forum. They, in the other hand, can block laws, can pass laws, have feminist presidents in their side, have big feminists journalists, judges and professors. They can and already did a big damage to men.They did more than just say some sexist shit in the Internet, they actually stopped us many times when we wanted to have our rights or have equality for men under the law or socially. And despite that a lot of feminists labeled every single MRA as a mysogynist, and with us being a small movement without influence or power, we couldn't do shit.While every single feminists defended feminism by saying the famous phrase '' those are not real feminists, real feminism is about equality'' and enforced the notion that any single one who criticize feminism is a either a mysogynist male or a woman who suffer from internalized misogyny.They served as a shield for the feminist movement, which was a platform for misandrist and sexist cunts to hurt men and stop them from getting the equality that they wanted.The only thing that they did is just say that feminism is a movement for equality and that those are not real feminists. Instead of actually doing something, removing those feminists from the position of power that they have, and actually reversing the damage.But they only served as a shield, as a defense for the feminist movement, the platform that those misandrists used to fuck men up. Those misandrists who not only had a platform from where they can do the sexist shit that they wanted, they didn't had a real threat to them, since even the feminists who claim to be good didn't try to actively remove them and correct what they have done.Those good feminists defended feminism even if it made things worse for men, because they used it to get their rights,they used men as a stepping stone to have what they want. The ''good'' feminists had their rights, the bad feminists had the vengeance that they wanted from men. Those good feminists didn’t want to oppose those misandrists who had the power, because they wanted to preserve their movement so that they can have their rights even if it meant to have men as a stepping stone.So good feminists, bad feminists, both for men had a role in using feminism as hate movement to fuck men up. And that's why I hate. And I don't the MRM to become like feminism. I don't want us to fall in the same mistake.",0.0

"You're right, but it's pretty clear to me that most won't see it that way. There is a big push now of male and female being seen as exactly the same (which is relevant to this sub of course). Let's be honest - young guys are horny bastards and the girls are focusing on other things like schoolwork and other activities. Except in some rare case, these events are not a poor little young Billy cowering in the corner as predator Patty is shoving her tits in his face. In the case of a male teacher and underage student though, I could see it being more forced, because males are horny fucks and girls don't want anything to do with dirty old guy dick. Most of this is common sense shit we just know, but online it's like blasphemy. Anyway, this obviously isn't an argument that will ever be settled. Where I do think we can probably end up agreeing though, is this: regardless of whether you think the women was really a predator, or if it was some idiot woman and a horny kid student, ultimately she did cross a legal line and she should face consequences. As much as we might see the story for what it really is - a pathetic women who wants attention and a young kid getting some ass - it wouldn't make sense to just let it go and say ""I understand"". Obviously you can't have teachers fucking their students, you'd have to fire them immediately regardless of the circumstances. And there should probably be legal punishment as well.So I think we need to take away our emotional attachment and hangups about these situations and treat it more objectively like a speeding ticket. Fucking one of your students? Fired and face whatever sentence is determined. I'm not going to call this stuff rape when the guy is happy to get ass from his hot teacher. But I can agree that these things can't just go on like it's no big deal either. ",0.0

"""Patriarchy"", in feminist lingo, largely seems to mean ""society that is run by men and is structured so as to benefit men at the expense of women"". You attempt to redefine it as ""the things in our society that hurt men"" is as pathetic as your attempt to pretend that anyone who dismisses male rape victims is an anti-feminist.> Feminists admit (hence the post) that patriarchy can benefit women in some ways, but we don’t even want the benefits. We just want equality.Feminists are incapable of admitting that they have privileges in our society, which is why they always phrase it as ""the patriarchy backfiring"" rather than say the words ""female privilege"". Feminists also very often cling to these benefits like a drowning woman to a spar of rock, and will defend them viciously. c.f. the National Organization of Women fighting against a presumption of joint custody (because men don't really want their children and just want a way to hurt women), the founder and CEO of the Feminist Majority Foundation dismissing the existence of male DV victims and  decrying the notion of legal parental surrender as ""men who just want to have sex without facing the consequences"", or the Women's March inviting Donna Hylton (convicted of torturing a man to death) and Rasmeah Odeh (convicted of a terrorist bombing in a cafe that killed two people) as featured speakers.> If egalitarians truly don’t believe in patriarchy then doesn’t that mean they think everything is already equal and society is running the way it naturally should..?I love the attempt to subtly argue that you either believe we live in a patriarchy or that you're a sexist. No, egalitarians believe that in our modern society, men and women have unfair advantages and disadvantages in different areas.

These ""workers"" were in offices, and usually were part of the ""management"", but in reality it was a shitty bureaucratic system that slowed down the factory...So they employed women in TESA positions, as most factory floor positions were men, in order to ""equalize"" the genders.The results was this: everyone wanted the nice non-working positions, therefore no one wanted the shitty labor intensive workplaces. The factories got so bogged down by the lack of workforce that they started to pay (even in communism... imagine that) far better the manual labors than the university degree TESA workers.Years later, a 8 class low skill manual laborer (male) could afford a car (total decadent luxury) and yearly seaside holidays (another decadent luxury) while a high skilled university degree TESA worker (usually a woman) could barely afford to live....And the irony was that when the system collapsed, the working men, that got the best wages and best stuff (free holidays, free transportation, free food) were the ones to revolt and topple the system... not the shitty intellectuals from TESA that were too scared to do shit.So... even if you mandate it, you still gonna get shit back.

">How does the rise in other ethnicities explain away the increasing trend of intermarriage as evidence of immigrants' children mingling?Because here is how it works: there are races, and within those races are ethnicities that are closer than ethnicities than other races. For example, Japanese marrying Chinese is more common than French and Chinese. Jamaican and Ethiopian is more common than Korean and Haitian. Irish and German is more common than Mexican and Nigerian. So you see, it depends how detailed the metrics are. The fact of the matter is, broadly asian and broadly white and broadly black and broadly south american are no closer than they have ever been. In fact, conflicts are worse than ever before. Both in the West and globally. Pan-African supremacist movements are at an all time strength in the US. Nation of Islam openly states that white people are subhuman mutants, but they see all Africans and Caribbeans as brothers and sisters. Pan-European white supremacist movements see the entirety of Europeans as one group. Welcome to the world as it is now. >The most common racial or ethnic pairing among newlywed intermarried couples is one Hispanic and one white spouse (42%). Next most common are one white and one Asian spouse (15%) and one white and one multiracial spouse (12%).This actually proves my point, the funny thing is you don't even see it because you don't understand this situation. White people see Hispanics as *closer genetically* than blacks. Closer *genetically* than Indians, than Arabs. The thing you fail to recognize is that everyone subconsciously understands this ranking of races that I just outlined, and that even within the *small minority* of interracial marriages they overwhelmingly trend towards people who are genetically white, or appear more white.What do you think about that?>If you think that ethnicity itself drives criminal behaviour, then you're being blatantly racist. I guess racism is correct.>Crime rates are driven by inequality, and inequality often breaks along ethnic lines.Wrong, inequality is not an analog measure, it is an infinite fractal and inadmissible as a scientific ranking. One cannot ""rate"" how unequal one group is to another, there are too many metrics. It's clear to me that people like you are so comfortable with using these words you have never actually thought about how complicated they are. How do you measure a gay Korean against an orphaned Congolese? A trans German who is poor against a trans Jamaican who is rich? And compare both of them to a trans Aboriginal in a wheelchair? How many government services are afforded to each? Who deserves what? You have no idea. You are a gatekeeper on an infinite downward spiral you refuse to recognize. >https://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/abs/10.1162/003465300559028What part of the paper proves your point? Quote it. You linked to a purchase page with a vague abstract. Show me the part in that paper that actually proves your point, you ""I just googled some shit and linked to a top result"" asshole.>Sadly, this widespread confusion fuels policies which see Canadian police forces funded, not based on actual crime rates, but based on the (mis)perceived threats posed by minorities.>https://www.mcgill.ca/newsroom/channels/news/perceived-threat-aboriginals-and-visible-minorities-255277Yeah, because increased police presence is an deterrent to crime. Here is a quote:>When they looked at the size of municipal police departments in the 40 largest cities in Canada between 1996 and 2006, the researchers discovered that cities with more visible minorities have larger police departments after crime rates, budget issues, and the population are accounted for. In fact, standardized statistical tests suggest that the presence of visible minorities in a city is by far the most significant predictor of police force size across Canadian cities.Again, *increased police presence is a deterrent to crime.* Here's a fun link for you. This is an article about Baltimore after police presence decreased in the wake of Black Lives Matter:https://www.npr.org/2017/12/31/574824963/baltimore-residents-blame-record-high-murder-rate-on-lower-police-presenceA quote:>For the third year in a row, Baltimore, Md., has had more than 300 murders, reaching a new record of murders per number of residents in 2017.>Some residents attribute the high murder rate to relaxed police patrols in the city following high-profile cases of police brutality. Officers have backed off in neighborhoods, like the one where Freddie Gray was arrested. Again: **when you decrease the police presence, crime increases.**Why?**BECAUSE THE INCREASED POLICE PRESENCE IN MINORITY AREAS IS BECAUSE THOSE MINORITIES COMMIT MORE CRIMES.**>Not sure why I would have to explain anything about various brains, especially since I already cited evidence showing that more diverse communities with more immigrants have less crime. You did not. Multicultural cities have more crime, especially interracial crime. *Especially* crime where blacks assault whites and other blacks. They are uniformly more violent than every other race and ethnicity. Stop sidestepping this blatantly obvious fact.>I'm not saying ""diversity at all costs,"" any more than you're saying ""all immigration is bad."" Yeah you did. You literally said diversity is a strength, you fucking retard.>But generally increased diversity IS good. There is evidence for that. You're just refusing to look at it. The data shows otherwise. Show me the data where adding Korean people to a company makes it more profitable. Show me the data where adding white people to a black company makes them more effective.

"Legally not justified but those twats fucking deserved it. There was a girl in my CS class in high school who liked to mess with me by digging her nails into my hand and arm, pulling on my beard and hair etc while taunting me showing that I can't do anything back to her because I would get arrested. One day I was in a shitty mood and just wanted to watch Hulu (That class was a fucking joke) so I put my headphones on and just ignored everything around me. She sat down next to me and said something to annoy me so I just said ""Fuck off, I'm not in the fucking mood"" which seemed to be code for ""Annoy me more than ever please."" and she dug her nails into my arm hard enough to draw blood and I somehow stopped myself from backhanding her in the face but instead I grabbed her wrist and just squeezed it really hard. She started screaming ""What the fuck? You're hurting me."" Security was notified and we went to talk to our principal who bitched out the girl completely while she was showing off the bruise on her wrist (It looked pretty bad tbh and I felt a little bad) but in the end he just gave us both detention.  I actually have a thing for girls who scratch me, especially with fake long nails but that's only when we're fucking and not some evil little shit wanting to cause me pain and discomfort just because she can without repercussions. I know I reacted poorly technically, I should have just notified security but everyone knows how that would make me look.

Blizzard used to be that company. You can still partially see it in the wc3 reforged team.

It's been happening across the industry for quite some time and the bullshit media has been insulating these devs from learning really valuable lessons in how to make legendary games that are beloved.It just hurts a bit more from a company that once had it so right.I get the feeling we're right on the cusp of a massive disrupt in the industry that will lead to more new dev teams creating games they as gamers want to play - SJW journo outlets that exist to simply appease publishers will continue to be bled dry by dwindling revenue via audience alienation and independent gaming journos until they fall completely out of relevancy.,0.0

"**Here's a trailer / store review (or personal impression, if you will):** The first contact with your game is through its title and short description, and they already tell me this is a politically charged game, and that the game takes a clear side in the culture war. At this point, I heavily suspect it will be heavy handed and preachy. My suspicions are reinforced after I start watching the video, as it contains too many ""buzzwords"" which makes it seem like it's a game aimed at die hard anti-SJWs only, and makes it feel too forced. Should be more subtle with these things. The action and the written explanation on the store is not good enough to convey what the gameplay is about to most people. You should show and explain better the game mechanics. If people are confused about your game from the get go, they wont even bother downloading a demo, much less buying it to try and refund if they dislike. The FAQ has a better explanation, but most users will not go out of their way and delve into the forum to try and figure out a game whose first impression was ""being weird"", ""clusterfuck"" or ""confusing gameplay"".I obviously didnt play the game, but the feeling I get from the material presented is that the SJW theme is just a skin that could be ripped off from the game and it wouldnt change the experience one bit, or even make it better from not feeling so forced or preachy. It feels like an after thought since it doesnt seem like its integrated to the gameplay aspect of the game. You could turn this into an office battle royale themed around office rage and disfunctional work relationships and it would be all the same, or possibly work better.I don't mean to sound harsh or anything, these are just my personal, unfiltered thoughts from my first contact with the store. In this context, my personal reaction would be to click ""not interested"" and ignore it. Your game is competing for attention with not only thousands of others, but also with the backlog of each steam gamer. Your first battle is to grab the interest of the public to keep looking at your video or reading your description. Your second one is to aptly convey what your game is all about, how it plays and instill a desire on the user to go out of their way and buy it in a short video and / or description.

"Forgive me, it's late, and I haven't slept.The BanOut: 2018 initiative targeted racist right wing subreddits to shut them down. The questions are: 1: What constitutes as racist, as there is a legitimate problem with the left calling those that don't agree with them racists, or even citing factual accredited statistics as racist.2: Were any anti-white, or other racist pages or accounts targeted? Is there a list available of the subs and users targeted by BanOut so that we can go see for ourselves what the racist content was that warranted banning?The fact that this BanOut initiative goes *at least* all the way to upper management in Reddit staff, Director of Policy at Reddit, Jessica Ashooh, who comes from a pretty questionable background in this instance; so that means that Reddit in some regards supports this initiative, and being they're a left leaning site, that's concerning, but not all that surprising.That coupled with you ""contacted a certain admin to let him/her know what I was going to do."" This admin who also works for left leaning Reddit, gave you the go ahead to troll the BanOut initiative to get it shut down. Which is kind've a funny thing to do for someone who legitimately believes the pages and accounts Ban:Out were targeting legitimately were racist.My theory I posit here, is that this was all an inside job to erase evidence and connections of Reddit staff and others to BanOut: 2018, as nothing changed besides the centralized hub and all evidence of BanOut was destroyed.

"The problem is deeper and more complex than you understand. Pornography is not legal in public, and attacking a network with spam is not legal either. Keeping discussion on topic by moderators is arguably the only purpose of moderators that isn't a breach of power.However, that is not what is happening. What is happening is that on topic discussions, that do not have any resemblance of spam or pornographic (or otherwise) content are censored because they do not fit a political narrative. Therefore, only one particular viewpoint can be presented. This causes new and naive users to only see one particular point of view. If that point of view is not correct, and if that is not in their best interest, they will inevitably be harmed by it. Understanding of social psychology, and utilization of big data allows a more comprehensive attack to take place, directing the knowledge and understanding of entire groups of people to a political aim. This is extremely dangerous in a democracy where successful manipulation of the majority of the vote is tantamount to turning any democracy into a dictatorship. ",0.0
"I wouldn't say he has a strong case. PayPal is a business and can choose who to do business with, so long as they aren't making that determination based on a protected class (race, gender, etc). No business is obligated to offer services to someone with whose views they don't agree, and though I would prefer this not apply to payment providers (whose only service is moving money around), unfortunately it does.The Unruh Civil Rights Act they cite makes no mention of political affiliation. It specifically outlaws discrimination based on sex, race, color, religion, ancestry, national origin, mental or physical disability, age or medical condition (including HIV status). HOWEVER (and this is what Jones is banking on) the California Supreme Court has held that the protections of the Unruh Act are not restricted to these characteristics.That being said, extending its protection to cover what can be characterized as conspiracy theories and related nonsense is going to be a really hard sell. If Paypal was discriminating against a guy for his choice of political candidate, maybe.

"> Oh, I get the reasoning.  I don't subscribe to it, though.  I think the definition of ""mentally ill"" is far too loose, and many of them should and could have gotten help to relieve it before it got to a point of becoming criminally dangerous.is that the fault of the sick person or the people around them?  because, for example, some schizophrenics aren’t aware they’re schizophrenic and episodes featuring visions that don’t actually exist are quite real to them.  they can’t tell the difference between their illness and reality.>After all, you don't get off of drunk driving because you were too drunk to make a rational decision.  likewise, mentally ill people that commit crimes are held accountable for them, sometimes with a measure of leniency that accounts for their illness.drinking and driving is not the same though.  if someone is sufficiently mentally ill and fall off their meds, they can’t tell they have.  and this doesn’t mean they see pink elephants that night, it’s a slow spiral until they do, and by that time pink elephants make total sense.  these kinds of lapses are ameliorated because what they suffer from is permanent and clouds judgment beyond what alcohol does.  they didn’t choose to go and drink/see elephants, they were born with it.  likewise personal responsibility while drunk is much more important because you choose how much to drink, how drunk you get, and then drive and hit someone.>You get put in jail because you chose to drink and left yourself a means to drive.  I think many of these people chose not to get help when they were of sounder mind, and should be punished for the exact same reasons.mental illness is still a deeply taboo subject, and plenty of people prefer to avoid inpatient psychiatric wards because, let’s be real, those places are hell on earth.  that and there are lasting complications from diagnoses.  even if you take your meds regularly and have never had problems, nearly every employer will probably turn you down from a job because of the diagnosis, even though you’ve never had an insane episode and have a perfect record.it’s understandable that people are sometimes unable to be aware that they aren’t taking medication, and are mostly rejected by society for a flaw in how they were born.  you don’t blame a dog for peeing on the carpet when it’s only ever peed on carpets - that’s it’s whole experience and all it knows.  you understand where the dog comes from and work with it to achieve a better result.as i’ve already said, this doesn’t excuse the crimes committed, and they do receive punishment for it.  but downplaying actual mental illness or saying that people choose to be mentally is just fucked.",0.0

"Each of the waves of feminism has made them essentially the ""SJW""s of their time, including the suffragettes, who were the precursor to feminism.Also, don't buy into the narrative that ""the previous waves are ok"" - they were all an example of movements with good intentions that had bad results and extremely bad actions.  They got some of what they wanted but a lot of shitty things happened to society to get to where they wanted.For example, you can thank the suffragettes for winning the women's vote, but also forgetting to require women to enroll in the selected service *to* vote and get student aid, meanwhile ALL MALES are required to do so.  Oh by the way, all rich property owners before the suffragette movement started were allowed to vote, INCLUDING WOMEN.

This is just a situation of a bitter ex wife. For all we know, she may not have wanted to put out for him any more and that lead him to stray. Ladies have to understand that unless there are legitimate health concerns, men want sex. It's a healthy part of a relationship. And if a woman denies them that without legitimate cause, then it could be reasonable justification for divorce or having an affair. Tell a woman that and they will go insane, but it's a simple truth. The same applies to woman as well. I have know girls who cheated on their boyfriends because they would not put out for them. But in these situations, the girls wanted to get pregnant. In any case, I would guess she was bitter before the affair. It is a part of 'empty nest syndrome'.

I’m not even approaching that from the typical criticisms of his work being that he’s sexist or some kind of bigot or whatever, I just think that his incarnation of Batman is... fucking weird.

Then you have All-Star Batman and Robin where Batman is just a huge gaping asshole to everybody, including Robin himself, doing things like calling him retarded and just generally throwing insults at people.Batman killing people in the 30’s/40’s lasted like 2 years before Bill Finger and Bob Kane rescinded it in Batman no. 4 (published in 1940). Batman in general, and comics in general, were nothing even remotely res resembling what they are today. Batman’s whole origin didn’t exist until, what, Detective Comics 33? 6 or 7 months after his actual debut. Batman’s first 2 and half years or so are so wildly different from the entire succeeding 8 decades that he may as well be someone entirely different. And Bill Finger and Bob Kane were the ones making the changes. They effectively rebooted Batman in 1940, and regardless of whatever the real world reason may have been, he didn’t kill people. Ever since, that’s been the definitive portrayal of Batman, and any time a writer has him overtly murder someone or even just not attempt to save someone from mortal danger, they’re writing him out of character as per Bill and Bob.",0.0

One of the reasons Thunderdome wasn't very good was the fact that all it did was go through the exact same story beats as Road Warrior (Max gets involved in other people's struggles, finds a piece of his lost humanity in the process, wanders off into the sunset), and in doing so, didn't progress his character arc at all.And that goes double for Fury Road, which on top of not doing it half as well as Thunderdome (let alone Road Warrior), made him a side character who could have been easily written out of the story altogether.",0.0
"I was commenting on what you said, not the article. You said the smallest person on the force, is male.You do realize physical strength generally favors men, right? If be willing to bet that this officer, if it came down to it, could absolutely destroy 95% of the females on the force. Simply because of the fact he's male, and males have more dense muscles, more dense bones, higher muscle as a percent of their body, and a ton of other stuff that makes them much more well suited for fighting than compared to a woman.So, I don't really care what the article says. It's common sense that men are almost always stronger than women. Does it hold true all the time? No. Does it hold true 99% of the time? Yes. ",0.0

"How many stories are about men giving up everything and risking it all for being with the perfect woman, protecting her, caring about her, etc.? I'm not saying it should be the rule of law, but for many people that's how they want to be and how they are. Now you will say because muh society, but it has always been that way. You don't have to like it. But if you deny that risking everything for love is something people do, then you are being disingenuous.  With Cinderella you should also consider that the prince loved her even when he found out what she really was. Like you can't ignore the fact they had no chance at meeting otherwise.     Aladdin is completely different, though. He literally created a whole, complex lie with stories made up of his deeds. Like there is a whole song of the Genie going around and saying outright lies about him. He created a whole new persona, while Cinderella just went to the ball.    Belle only started liking the Beast once he started being nicer. She hated and feared him when he was mean. Girl kept trying to get away from him. It's again, disingenuous to say she fell in love with him.   Both him and Gaston started out as dickbags, but the Beast was willing to work on himself and become a much better person. Gaston, even to his last moment was an aggressive person and refused to listen to Belle. Even with Maurice, while the Beast imprisoned him at first, he exchanged him for Belle, then also let even her go when Maurice was ill.   To me one of the big themes of the movie is how you can change, better yourself and set things right if you try. (I think one song in the movie even has lyrics along those lines.)

Elizabeth Cady Stanton  > Elizabeth Cady Stanton (November 12, 1815 – October 26, 1902) was an American suffragist, social activist, abolitionist, and leading figure of the early women's rights movement. Her Declaration of Sentiments, presented at the Seneca Falls Convention held in 1848 in Seneca Falls, New York, is often credited with initiating the first organized women's rights and women's suffrage movements in the United States.[1][2] Stanton was president of the National Woman Suffrage Association from 1892 until 1900.      Sally Miller Gearhart  > Sally Miller Gearhart (born April 15, 1931) is an American teacher, feminist, science-fiction writer, and political activist.[1] In 1973, she became the first open lesbian to obtain a tenure-track faculty position when she was hired by San Francisco State University, where she helped establish one of the first women and gender study programs in the country.[2] She later became a nationally known gay rights activist.    And Andrea Dworkin, whom I probably don't have to introduce at all.  Conveniently, she is the only one who is considered a radical feminist, though not at all a little fringe no-name nobody.   Please, do the typical thing and declare that the biggest of big name organisers or feminism are totally not actual feminists.

"Let's bring it back to the gaming aspect for a moment. (Disclaimer, the following response is not to the guy I am responding to, but to the mindset of the writer in a specific situation.)""I enjoy videogames, but I'm not good at it and I don't want to be""Alright then. Here's a simple advice: Do. Not. Play. Multiplayer. At all. Play Singleplayer games that are narrative driven and have a good time. Proudly select the lowest difficulty. Cheat like there is no tomorrow. Make it fun for you, because singleplayer is ALL about you. Multiplayer isn't. If you do not want to shoot for greatness, if you do not want to become better at it, do not play multiplayer. Especially not with that attitude. If you ""do not want to be good"" at it, you are Dead Weight for your team. You make things worse for way more people than just little ol' yourself. You WILL get shit.

You do NOT matter more than them and not giving the best you got and not actively trying to get better is an insult to your team. If you want to matter, and not have to get good, singleplayer is there for you. There are loads of guides on the net (google-fu is your friend), there are trainers, cheats, instructions, videos, maps, step by step solutions, you can always find a solution. But even in singleplayer games, depending on the game, the answer will sometimes be ""Get Better"". That game then might not be for you.

And last night, I failed.One as regal as I, failing? Impossible. Only the gods could achieve such power to stop me. I guess that night I was dealing with a god.I'm on the YouTube homepage, trying to find some epic Morgz videos, when I stumble upon a certain video. This damn video. Its bright thumbnail, its captivating title - it utterly fascinated me. This cursed video: it was none other than “Fortnite's most EPIC event EVER!”, posted by the one and only Ali A.My body immediately began to shake, and my penis shot straight up. The most EPIC event EVER? What could it be? I felt a pull towards the video like I had never felt before. It took me awhile to realize the effect the video was having on me. I fell back in my chair in fear. In agony. In complete and utter despair.My hand instinctively grabbed the mouse and began to slowly slide over to the thumbnail. I kicked and screamed and cried, trying and failing to stop my body. Sweat was dripping down my entire body. Minutes later, the pointer had finally reached its destination. And with a cry, the hand that didn't feel like mine anymore clicked.I was immediately met with a scream. “THIS IS IT LADIES AND GENTLEMEN!” Purple light streamed from the computer monitor and began to fill the room. The voice on the screen continued talking, seemingly in an ancient tongue. My entire body began to quiver as something awakened inside of me. My speakers began to shake as something inside of them grew louder. Was this music? Or was this something else?The music finally picked up, and immediately, as Ali's intro began, I came harder and faster than I ever had before. The sensation rendered me unconscious. The last thing I remember seeing that night was my cum streaked over his face. And it looked like he was smiling.I woke up to a rising sun. My clothes were back on, my sweat was wiped away, and my penis was flaccid. I could finally see again. Was this all a dream? No, there’s no way. It felt too real.My suspicions were immediately crushed as I looked to the monitor. In a drunk stupor, it looks like I had changed my desktop background to a picture of him. He was staring into my heart - into my soul. And he was covered in my cum.So, guys, whatever you do, don’t watch Ali A's newest video. Anybody less powerful than I would surely be dead.

The platform administrators should concern itself with things that destabilize the platform, and provide tools so the users themselves can control the content they see.> These are wildly different things in both a digital and legal sense. Your emails are private communications. You literally have (under American law) an expectation of privacy which even the police are not allowed to violate without proper judicial and legal grounds.Usenet is perhaps a better example because it is a public forum that employs a similar model of moderation to email. The ISP Usenet servers oftentimes filtered spam and the binary groups, but the posts themselves weren't removed from the system; so you could usually pay for access to servers that didn't filter. And while some groups were moderated, others weren't; and the moderated groups maintained their own rules. If you preferred to read the unmoderated groups, a client-side killfile provided crude means for user-controlled filtering.Usenet's technical considerations aside, I think modern platforms would get less push-back if they adopted/improved upon that approach to moderation: the platform just serves you the messages, lets you post, and provides tools for users and groups to moderate as they see fit without global posting guidelines. If something is actually illegal (in the ""forward to the FBI upon removal"" sense), or a court orders its removal, then the admins can pull it.> The report specifically tells them to be politically neutral as part of being more consistent with their rules because tech companies haven't been.

It's why you can't just run up to someone and start screaming ""FAGGOT!!!!"" in their face, and why American law would probably allow them to hit you to get away from them.True, but I might be able to run up to a friend and do that without being hit. Are tech platforms able to make that sort of distinction? So far they haven't done so, either because they don't want to, because it's a hard problem for the AI systems they're using, or because the content being flagged is being reviewed by someone who doesn't understand the context well enough to make the distinction.> They actually say that users will have shifting desires and demands, and a one-size-all approach doesn't fit.They say that [in context of changing their rules over time](https://imgur.com/Q4vdZAl).

"This one was by far the most damning :The Progressive Stack: An Intersectional Feminist Approach to PedagogyIn the name of Maria Gonzalez, Ph.D. (fictitious) of the (fictitious) Feminist Activist Collective for Truth(FACT)Discipline/subdiscipline: feminist pedagogy (philosophy of education)Summary: This is our most appalling paper, and it’s deeply concerning that how it is being treated at thehighly respected journal Hypatia. It forwards that educators should discriminate by identity and calculatetheir students’ status in terms of privilege, favor the least privileged with more time, attention and positivefeedback and penalize the most privileged by declining to hear their contributions, deriding their input,intentionally speaking over them, and making them sit on the floor in chains—framed as educationalopportunities we termed “experiential reparations.”Purpose: Patently unfair, inhumane, and abusive treatments of students will be acceptable in educationaltheory if it is framed as an opportunity to teach them about the problems of privilege.Note: This paper insists that the most privileged students shouldn't be allowed to speak in class at all andshould just listen and learn in silence throughout the term. Even more, it insists that students with highprivilege could benefit from adding on “experiential reparations,” such as sitting in the floor, wearingchains, or intentionally being spoken over, as an educational “opportunity” within the class. Thereviewers’ only concerns with these points so far have been that (1) we approach the topic with too much compassion for the students who are being subjected to this, and (2) we risk exploiting underprivilegedstudents by burdening them with an expectation to teach about privilege. To correct for this, the reviewersurged us to make sure we avoid “recentering the needs of the privileged.” They asked us to incorporateMegan Boler’s approach called “pedagogy of discomfort” and Barbara Applebaum’s insistence that theprivileged learn from this discomfort rather than being coddled or having their own experiences(suffering) “recentered.” It also utilizes Robin DiAngelo’s now-famous concept of “white fragility” toexplain why students subjected to this treatment will object to it, and uses that to justify the more crueltreatment suggested by the reviewers. The reviewers acknowledged that they believe this “fragility” is thecorrect interpretation for student pushback against being told to stay silent and sit in the floor, possibly inchains, throughout the semester.Notes on Status:Three times “reject and resubmit” at Hypatia(This status means that the journal is interested in the paper but does not consider it successful enough toput on track for acceptance. It’s weakly positive.)Selected Reviewer Comments:“This is a solid essay that, with revision, will make a strong contribution to the growing literature onaddressing epistemic injustice in the classroom. The focus on the Progressive Stack is interesting yetfocused and it is great that the author is trying to suggest some specific approaches.” -Reviewer 1, firstreview, Hypatia“I like this project very much. I think the author’s insights are on target and I think that the literature onepistemic injustice has lots to of er classroom pedagogies, I encourage the author to continue working onthis project.” -Reviewer 2, first review, Hypatia“This is a worthwhile and interesting project. The essay is just not ready yet.” -Reviewer 2, secondreview, Hypatia",0.0

">A Warr Acres woman is accused of taking more than $450,000 from a man with Alzheimer's disease when she was supposed to be taking care of him.>Going back as far as 2011So she has been doing this for 7 years.>After gaining power of attorney over him, police say Smith-Frawner began by deeding his Warr Acres home over to herself via quitclaim deed for just $1.What the fuck.>According to court documents, she added herself to his bank account and, in 2015, started making withdrawals and writing herself checks. These include a $77,229.28 cashier's check ""used to pay off a BancFirst loan in the name of Cindy Smith in 2015."" Another was a withdrawal posted to the victim's account in October 2017 in the amount of $29,371.86. That was a payment ""made to Honda Financial to pay off a 2016 Honda Accord that was registered to Cindy Smith."">The documents allege that in August of 2017, a $10,000 cashier's check from the victim's account went to Emerald Springs Spas ""for a down payment on a hot tub"" that was set up at Smith-Frawner's residence. The total price of the hot tub and accessories was $14,489.10. Smith-Frawner also took out a loan for the remaining balance from the Oklahoma Educator's Credit Union, then a month later, $4,682.39 was taken out of the victim's account to pay off a loan at the Oklahoma Educator's Credit Union.>Then, in October 2017, $295,000 was transferred from the victim's bank account to her personal account, one the victim did not have access to.>Investigators say the total equaled over $450,000. They note that that number does not include other suspicious transactions, the value of the house she allegedly did not pay for and a Chevy Avalanche that belonged to the victim.>Smith-Frawner is accused of taking most of the Navy veteran's life savings, and leaving him a little more than $40,000.>We did, however, speak to her attorney, Billy Bock, who insists the man cared for Smith-Frawner like a daughter, and knew about the transactions.>Everything was done under his wishes,"" Bock said. ""I understand he doesn't remember that now and it's sad. I wish he did.>My client did not knowingly deceive or defraud or take money away from [him] in any way other than what his wishes are,"" Bock said.This lawyer sounds scummy at best.>Altogether, penalties could include 37 years in prison and $85,000 in fines.This is all. This is bs. She will not get the max. My guess is she will get less than 10 years. So steal $600,000+ and only have to pay back $85,000.I am guessing the house was worth more than $100,000 dollars.So the $450,000 + other transactions not included in the $450,000 + $100,000+ house = $600,000.Investigators say the total equaled over $450,000.

"> The people who get called racist, xenophobic or ""right-wingers"" tend to be the ones who conflate all Muslims with radical Islamists.Ayaan Hirsi Ali, Maajid Nawaz and even *Tommy Fucking Robinson* frequently make clear they aren't talking about all Muslims, and they frequently distinguish between ""Islamists"" and ""most Muslims in the west."" They still get called ""radical racist xenophobic right-wingers."">The experience you will gain, backed with factual statistics, will show you that the vast majority of Muslims are peaceful and simply want to be left alone to get on with their lives. The factual statistics also suggest that a very large percentage of Muslims are socially and theologically conservative, and would favor laws that restrict our civil liberties in the name of their religion. A survey of British Muslims found that a *supermajority* thought homosexuality should be criminalized.Sure, they aren't necessarily *jihadists*. But if you believe in forcing society to live by Islamic norms *even via the ballot box* then you're an Islamist (""Jihadists"" are Islamists who support terrorism as a means to forcing society to live by Islamic norms). Yes, there are many Muslims whom are not Islamists. But we need to take the problem seriously. We saw the theocratic nonsense spouted by the religious right back in the George W Bush administration for the *threat it was*, and we didn't make excuses for them like ""but they're nonviolent, they want a democratic process to restrict our rights."" Islamists should be viewed with the same suspicion, if not more, that was cast upon the Dominionists.>When people start making claims that ""all"" Muslims are jihadists, or being Muslim inherently means you are a violent extremist, or follow an extremist ideology - that's when you will get called racist, xenophobic or right-wing.Again, not even Tommy Robinson supports that viewpoint. In addition, some people are *very eager to conflate* the proposition that ""some verses in the Quran and some theological positions that are prominent in the Islamic world logically support Jihadists"" with the proposition that ""all Muslims are violent extremists."" Take a look at how Sam Harris was treated by Ben Affleck. >Do you have a list of ""official"" organs of the ""establishment left""?

But the Islamic equivalent doesn't get treated with the same scorn.>They might never take part in any sort of activism to force their view on people, but there's no evidence to say that this ""supermajority"" of Muslims would do so, eitherThe Religious Right has indeed tried to commandeer the State to enforce their policy preferences on others. Nothing says that fundamentalist Muslims wouldn't act similarly.>Tommy Robinson may stop short of literally saying ""All Muslims are jihadists"" or ""all Muslims are extremists"" but he virtually says it, with weasel words. His (and others like him) line is ""Muslim is an extremist ideology"". Which has the implication that anyone who follows it is an extremist, whereas in fact the vast majority of Muslims clearly do not follow Islam to extremist lengths.Tommy Robinson isn't someone with multiple college degrees. He's not going to speak in an highly precise, polished, educated manner on the subject and it reeks of classism to basically demand he do so. Yes, he knows not all Muslims are Islamists, he knows the distinction and has affirmed it at multiple times. You say he's using ""weasel words"" but if you want to condemn activists for not using sufficiently qualified, nuanced language, Tommy Robinson is a relatively mild offender. It isn't wrong to say that Islam, if by ""Islam"" we're speaking in terms of popularly and widely embraced interpretations and understandings thereof, does indeed contain tenets which don't precisely fit in nicely with modern western cosmopolitan pluralistic liberal democracy. When we were critiquing the religious right, we made *absolutely no bones* about citing ""clobber verses"" from their holy texts and pointing out that these stood in the way of them embracing a tolerant interpretation of their religion. We also very rarely brought out huge levels of theological nuance, we rarely took great pains to distinguish between denominations, and we didn't get called bigots for doing so (except by the religious right themselves, whom are not taken seriously).Why, pray tell, is the *same treatment* some unfathomable bigotry?Yes, I know about the Mu'tazilites, and I know there are the Ibadis and the Ahmadis blah blah blah, but you can't *bitch about linguistics* as a way to get around the fact that in today's world, *an extremely large proportion of Muslims are Salafist or Deobandist*. Are you going to bitch about Tommy not being able to cite Averroes' views on the number of angels that could stand on a pinhead? Or are you going to actually confront the meat of the criticism? >I am sure you know full well that this is entirely subjective. Outlets like HuffPo and Guardian are generally considered ""left-leaning MSM"" but among right wing/alt-right circles they are often referred to as ""far left"" or even ""extremist"".Yes, what counts as ""moderate"" and what counts as ""extreme"" can be subjective. No surprises there.>Personally I think a good indicator of whether an opinion/belief is extreme or moderate, is whether it involves imposing your will on other people. Hence ""Abortion should be illegal"" = extreme While ""Everyone should have the choice whether or not to engage in abortion"" = moderate.Well then by that definition I'm perfectly moderate, since I'm a libertarian. Although some would call my ideology, which is defined by a refusal to impose my will upon others, ""extreme."">That's a big part of the reason why I consider myself a liberal/progressive, rather than a conservative. To me, the liberal/progressive option is more often than not the one which involves giving people a choice, while the conservative/reactionary position is one which involves removing choice. (Gun control being the notable exception, I suppose).School choice is another. And the fact that a huge slice of the 'progressive' left thinks that free speech is a cis het white male conspiracy to oppress others. The liberal tradition cares about individual choice... the Progressive tradition, which is rooted ultimately in the works of the totalitarian Auguste Comte, is not in favor of individual choice.

"In the state of California an engagement ring is a promise! Not an unconditional gift. By law it has to be given back unless its after marriage. What a fucking entitled slut cunt!""In California we turn to a law dating back to 1939 which specifically addresses engagement rings and other gifts in contemplation of marriage--Civil Code section 1590; it states: Where either party to a contemplated marriage in this State makes a gift of money or property to the other on the basis or assumption that the marriage will take place, in the event that the donee refuses to enter into the marriage as contemplated or that it is given up by mutual consent, the donor may recover such gift or such part of its value as may, under all of the circumstances of the case, be found by a court or jury to be just. In this case the ""donor"" is the person (i.e., the man) giving the engagement ring, and the ""donee"" is the person (i.e., the woman) receiving it. A gift in contemplation of marriage can be revoked, unlike other gifts. Thus, California law is very clear on what happens to the ring - if the woman calls off the wedding, it goes back to the man. Also, if both parties agree that the wedding is off then the man gets the ring back. This California law has wide ranging impact for property given in contemplation of marriage. In an important case on the subject - Shaw v. Shaw (1964) 227 Cal.App.2d 159, a man and woman lived together for four years. He placed her name on real property because he relied on her promise that she would marry him when her divorce was final. The couple separated before marrying and the woman eventually married another. The court awarded all property back to the man because she failed to marry him. This has an impact on our society today because of the number of couples living together before marriage.""",1.0

">New immigrants tend to cluster, but their kids tend to mingle. The link you posted does not reinforce this point, it merely says more people intermarry, but that is easily correlated with a rise in other ethnicities and the trend of whites to become a national minority. The percentage of marriages is actually not that impressive when you compare it to the disproportionate rise in non-whites. It would be a valid argument if the demographics stayed the same. As it stands, 1 in 10 married people being interracially married is actually a really poor number.>And despite the propaganda spread around here and Fox News, immigrants tend to commit less crime than native-bornDepends on the immigrants, not all immigrants are weighed equally. This is the part people like you always forget. For example, Jamaican and Haitian immigrants commit way more crime than Dutch and German immigrants. Literally zero people on the Right are claiming all immigrants are the same, but it is statistically more likely for Mexican immigrants to commit crime than Japanese people. Those are numbers you cannot debate, which is likely why you strawman the conservative position.>communities with higher immigration levels tend to have less crime overall. Not necessarily, poor Jews commit way less crime than poor Blacks. We can find all sorts of exceptions. Rich Arabs and Muslims tend to amplify their backwards and regressive views, money has little to do with it. If that were the case, Saudi Arabia wouldn't be the World's Richest Hellhole.>Those pesky facts: guess diversity really is strength. Once again, you people don't actually understand the points being raised by the Right. When immigration control is right - like it was in Canada until just recently - immigration is a net benefit. Again, *literally zero conservatives say otherwise.* Canada has one of the most restrictive immigration programs on the planet. The United States had the same. The United States, and Donald Trump, have never once claimed immigration is bad. Never once. What they say is unchecked and unvetted immigration is bad. And it is. This is the problem with Mexico. By the way, Mexico agrees with this which is why it is so restrictive with Guatemala. Donald Trump wants to make America's immigration policy more like Canada's.Diversity *for the sake of diversity* is not a strength. That is retarded. There is absolutely no data to back that up. If you believe so, you will have to explain to us how blacks, jews, and indians have different brains than whites. You'll have to explain how *on a genetic level* they are different, as well as cultural. To argue for diversity being a strength, you are in fact arguing for racism. Here's a spoiler for how this is going to go, though: once you codify these racial differences, you will be able to chart them based on higher value and lower value. You cannot say ""this is different"" without also assigning a relative value to it. Once you do that, we will be able to have a conversation about which immigrants are *better* than others.

"Yep. It's I guess if you forgive my bard level faggotry, delightfully flawed- or at least it's characters are, and flawed but not shit written characters are the best ones IMO.Kazuma despite of everything is the most competent in his party by dozens of leagues, because he's the only one that completely controlled by pure whim, and arguably lust. Which sounds hilarious given what a horndog he is, but regardless of how often his ""steal"" ability grants him frilly unmentionables, this is not his intent- it's just a roll of the dice( well his second use when he got megumin's knickers I think he was trying for them- but I think he was going for aqua's because he wanted to humiliate the conceited harpy cunt. He just doesn't get them due to fan theory that I agree with, that she doesn't WEAR any and if they exist his steal ability seems to have a laser guided focus on lady lace, so it went to the target a foot over which was wearing some.Still, think of it megumin refuses to learn any skills that doesn't buff her explosion magic, it may be because she sees it as the ultimate cool and her race is like cool for it's own sake magical otakus, but given how she behaves talking about her one spell or using it, she seems to *literally* get off on using it- even more suggested by her demand to be able to shoot off one nuke a day even if there isn't anything that needs it- though given her age and the fact she might have just found the puberty fairy(but sadly not the boob fairy) the spell might actually get her off, and unlike what some people claim girls can be just as much(and the more years I live I suspect even MORE)horny than dudes, and given found the awesomeness of explosion orgasms she ain't gonna give that up if she can at all help it. Then there is the wondrous clusterfuck of useless lust that is darkness, which you don't even have to imagine being there- it's shamefully(how appropriate) shown for all the world to see. Who my theory was intentionally gimped her accuracy stats- or might well be *deliberately* missing her strikes because as is shown by vanir when he controls her, she can hit like a mac truck on hate and crack. Well what fun is one shotting monsters when she honestly seems like she'd rather be an adventurer in the goblin slayer universe? She'd rather be taking the hits than giving them. honestly it would make more sense if she just bought a shield and never took a sword with her- then again that might also defeat the *purpose* for her.In comparison kazuma is going massively into jack of all trades, which usually gimps the fuck out of you in most games- video games anyway, maybe it works better in p&p games where the point is writing a story through your actions so letting you do whatever you want as long as it doesn't fuck with the dm's plot is encouraged. Also given how cripplingly insanely overspecialized the other party members are the only way to save the party is probably for someone to go full utility. Save aqua. Oddly enough she has power and mana and to spare, her idiocy is what makes her useless. That and her spoiled bitchy attitude. Take the frogs, now I dind't know this until someone who may have guessed or it's spelle dout in the other mediums, that the reason she didn't kill the fuck out of it with shit like godblow was because being a **WATER** goddess, even her holy attacks still have a dual element with water. If she wasn't stupid she'd *KNOW* that and not try to directly attack the frogs with spells and just buff or heal kazuma. Fuck she was so stupid when she was smiting the dulahan she didn't seem tot think her smiting/turning didn't have *any* effect on him because it didn't one shot him, despite him rolling on the ground screaming.

"It's really simple:It is against the feminist ethos to directly help men with anything but, at best, a demand that they stop hitting themselves. Feminism is legitimately and truly predicated on the idea that women have it worse in every conceivable realm than men, and any appearances to the contrary are just because of 'inaccurate lensing'. More homeless men? It's because of men not wanting to seem womanly and seeking help. Well it's actually because women are oppressed into not committing suicide because they are so conditioned to put others' happiness before their own. More deaths on the job for men? It is again because they are conditioned to view the female condition as weak and thus equate weakness with femininity thus do not properly seek safety, and also these jobs are run by MEN.This is not even strawmanning them.

The author seems to be under the impression that because gaming journalism is inherently shallow, it attracts people who are essentially well-meaning schlubs with no talent. He doesn't stop to consider that the quality may be shit because it's filled with people who are *malicious*; people who aren't just doing this because they like talking about stuff, but people who fucking hate the thing they cover and want to destroy it.And I'm not sure why he thinks this. Is it because gaming publications are inherently aimed at hobbyists and would thus preclude any advancement into serious fields? If so, he should stop to consider that it isn't 2005; video games are not some thing you do in a basement somewhere. They're a multi-billion dollar industry and so the defense a small hobby has against social climbers is virtually gone. And that's not mentioning how becoming popular within a niche is a well known tactic; it's how the Paul brothers got rich, and Cardi B, and virtually every ""sensation"" since Justin Bieber. Why wouldn't opportunists be lurking around? Why *wouldn't* an industry bigger than movies have people willing to tank their own reputations to destroy it?More to the point, it *is* possible to produce quality content we could describe as ""gaming journalism"". Yeah, rehashing press releases is stupid and non-productive, but there are people who conduct interviews with developers, mess around with hardware, report on the society and culture surrounding games, (in ways that aren't just polemics against consumers) conduct serious reviews of titles, etc, etc.So I don't think ""game journalism sucks because it's just not possible for it not to suck"" is at all a valid stance to take; it's lazy and ignores the fact that gaming publications hire people who fucking hate video games. This naive view of games journalism still being issues of *Nintendo Power* and shit like ""Ctrl+Alt+Del"" is just flat-out wrong. If this guy was a political consultant, he'd be giving advice to candidates in 2018 on how to beat Dick Nixon, appeal to the Confederate war veterans in Georgia, and stick it to the USSR.",1.0

"We women don't constantly fear a man kidnapping us and ass-raping us until we die, and there is no ""good reason"" to do so. That sounds the same as when feminists claim that every time a woman engages in sex she's also incredibly afraid that if she said no the man would rape her. It's a scare tactic used to shame and silence men and it has no basis in reality. By your logic, every man is deeply afraid every night he goes to bed that his wife or girlfriend will cut off his penis while he's sleeping. And then, you know, have the entire country laugh at him as they barbecue wieners and cheer his female partner. It is frequently reinforced by the culture that females never rape, sexually assault or harass men, but that's largely a reflection of our inability to see and tendency to dismiss it when it happens. A man grabs a woman's crotch? He's practically a rapist, even if she liked it, he was supposed to ask first. Woman grabs a man's crotch? She's just a strong sexually empowered female who goes after what she wants, or at least it was just for fun and he didn't mind anyway, he probably liked it. By the way, here's a study which states ""the CDC’s nationally representative data revealed that over one year, men and women were equally likely to experience nonconsensual sex, and most male victims reported female perpetrators.""https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/sexual-victimization-by-women-is-more-common-than-previously-known/",0.0

"> venom isn't supposed to be some ruthless psychopath that kills indiscriminately imoHe's not in the comics, he's an anti-hero who's got a grudge against Spiderman for screwing him over, Brock has a similar motivation and as a result they fuse and their desire for vengeance fuels them. Venom isn't supposed to be this heroic incarnation they've stuck together from spare parts. He's supposed to be self interested and only sides with Spiderman out of convenience. In this film he's basically just a hero trying to save the world for selfless reasons.The movie should've been R as well considering the amounts of violence in the comics, Venom is supposed to literally eat people's heads. It doesn't even really matter if you don't want to be totally devoted to aligning with comic lore but they've departed so much from the subject matter that they've essentially made an entirely new thing that's hardly like Venom in the comics.How do they play this off anyway with more Venom comics? Do they just ignore this movie and keep making the same thing or do they decide they're going to ignore 34 years of comics involving the interplay between Spiderman and Venom in favor of this Sony amalgamation? Probably the former. So when some kid goes and tries to get a Venom comic because he liked the movie he's either going to be confused or annoyed, possibly both.Venom is a pussy because he's said to be one in the movie, he admits that he's one of the weaker symbiotes. In the comics (and the TV show for that matter) he's basically one of a few of Spiderman's arch-nemeses as a result of his past host with Spiderman, allowing him to give his host the powers of Spiderman and prevent Spiderman from detecting Venom with his spider sense. Also depending on which host you're talking about Venom is either weaker than some other Symbiotes or much stronger. Hell even Eddie Brock once fought and beat Superman in a crossover comic and still held his own when Superman and Spiderman worked together. Venom even fought on even footing with Juggernaut. This also divorces the Venom lore from the very recent comics involving Knull which is a whole other thing altogether.The real reason they made this shit movie is Sony needed to churn something out so they keep a hold on a bit of their Marvel licenses that they haven't let lapse.",0.0

I'm gay and don't feel the need to disclose my sexuality to everyone I'm meeting. It comes up organically usually, mentioning my boyfriend or, occasionally, I think a guy is cute and tell him, ""Hey, I'm assuming you're straight but I just had to make sure because I think you're really handsome."" And, in this supposedly extremely homophobic and gay-bashing climate we live in, pretty much every guy has said, ""Oh man, that's really flattering, but sorry, I'm straight."" (Seriously though, I've yet to meet a straight guy who's been anything but flattered and polite about me finding him attractive enough to approach and ask out). People tell me that I don't usually ""ping"" on their gaydar so I've gone quite a while with people not knowing and then one day I mention my boyfriend or something and they go, ""Wait, you're gay? How come you never said anything?!"" And it's kind of like, ""I mean, you didn't waltz up to me and say, 'Hey, I'm straight, I just wanted you to know that I'm attracted to the opposite sex.'""

"Among the stupid shit Verhoeven added, changed, or left out to make it look bad.1. Conscription is banned in the Terran Federation, ( I'm pretty sure it applies to the movie but it is never explicitly stated or stressed ), not only that, but you can quit anytime you want, even right before a combat drop (Though you won't get your citizenship). Heinlein was very critical the American Military's use of conscription and devotes several paragraphs to deconstructing it and even name drops the then contemporary Korean war as an example. All the more ironic when you consider Verhoeven's own misgivings about the american military.2. In the book, the mobile infantry is an elite army utilizing orbital drop-pods, and power armor with enough fire-power to level city blocks, ( A formation with soldiers a kilometer apart is considered and dangerous risk for friendly fire, and at one point Rico uses mini nukes ) Essentially being WH40K Space Marines in all but name ( Minus genetic modification). That Is why they fight without tanks or artillery, which are explicitly stated to be obsolete compared to an M.I. soldier. The movie instead makes the M.I. look like the WH40k Imperial guard if it was led by Zapp Brannigan, rushing masses of ill equipped soldiers like a moron.3. You don't need to be a citizen to have children. The only rights a citizen has over a civilian is the right to vote or run for office in the Terran Federation.4. There are other forms of service apart from the military one can sign up for that will grant  citizenship, though they are similarly dangerous, dirty, and grueling.5. The Bugs are a technologically advanced race with an interstellar empire, not just some wildlife on an isolated planet. The attack on Sao Paulo is most definitely *NOT* a false flag, as the movie implies.6. No attention is given in the movie to the near non-existance of racism, racial strife or sexism between humans in the Terran Federation. Units are mixed with people from all ethnicities and cultures. The Main character Juan Rico is in fact Filipino, though even book readers might miss this, as it is only inferred through two random lines where he mentions [Ramon Magsaysay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramon_Magsaysay) and that he speaks tagalog. Obviously Verhoeven couldn't let people think that anything other than globohomo peace and tolerance hippie ideals will lead to a internally peaceful society. 7. For the M.I. recruiting office, they hire only the most crippled and mangled veterans they can find. The one Juan Rico meets is missing half his face and 3 limbs. His job to scare away anyone who isn't really dedicated and to make it very, very clear what dangerous dirty and grueling life you will have in the M.I. which itself is *extremely* selective, only %9 of Rico's starting group is able to pass and complete training. There is no propaganda machine brainwashing people, and there are no illusions given that service will be anything but dangerous, dirty and grueling.

"The first video posted doesn't even concretely prove anything. YouTubers experience burnout due to increasing lack of ad revenue, Better Help comes around, people start it and get sponsored by it. The closing statement in Memeology's video trys to say that based on the sole fact that different people use the service, it must be a shill. Hell, Boogie even said to not use his link if you didn't want to give him money. Nobody is conning perfectly healthy people into signing up for online therapy, like your Lexus comparison would suggest. If that's happening, it's on the person doing it. The way info gets presented in the other vids, it suggests YouTube is forcing the sponsorship on creators, and that just doesn't make sense to me. Regardless of how a sponsor comes into play, if all relevant info being told about the service is true and the option to not participate in the sponsor link is there, how are people being manipulated?Also, not sure if I missed something or am just blanking, but I'm fairly confused why people are attacking the quality of the service. The 2nd video seems to joke about how the woman isn't a doctor, but I don't recall any claims of every professional being a literal doctor. That video also ends with by saying this projects depression onto viewers, and I simply don't get that. If you're that susceptible to other's words, you'd either have to be an actual child or you really do need therapy. Without relying too much on speculation and by just looking at the info from the vids and my own experience, it seems that, at worst, BetterHelp and YouTube are partnered. YouTube identified relevant creators to be partnered with the service to advertise it. The information presented about the service and the service itself seem perfectly fine. I saw people having issues with being denied service and that they were suggested to see a physical therapist as opposed to online therapy. I get being upset at that, but how is that bad? Instead of not getting the help you need or giving bad help, they inform the person why the service wouldn't be beneficial to them. Like, I don't see what else could be done about that. ",0.0

I responded to the insult because there is absolutely no ""actual point"", it's just a jab at the ""leftist retard"" PM.Let's go over the facts, shall we?The supreme court [ruled in 2010](https://scc-csc.lexum.com/scc-csc/scc-csc/en/item/7842/index.do) that Canada failed in its constitutional obligations to Khadr on several counts, most notably that Canadian officials breached Khadr's rights by interrogating him knowing that he had been tortured (their term is ""oppressive circumstances"") and that the Canadian government had failed to uphold Khadr's constitutional rights when it ignored Khadr's request for repatriation. This all occurred under Harper's time as PM; the payout was the result of a settlement coming from Khadr's $20M suit against Canada for wrongful imprisonment and failing to protecting him as a Canadian citizen.Now we can argue all day what you or I would have done as PM, but with the SCOC ruling that Canada had in fact failed its citizen and the $20M pending lawsuit, Canada decided to settle. Would you be as angry if Canada had decided to let the suit proceed and risk a $20M payout on top of legal fees and court costs? Remember that it was your boy Harper who created this mess, and the full impact wasn't seen until after he'd been booted out of office.We can also argue all day whether you would consider the SCOC's decision was a demand to pay Khadr $10.5M or not, but it seems prudent that if the SCOC has already ruled that you fucked up and the man you fucked has a $20M suit against you, you might want to try to cut a deal, no? So in terms of absolute ""who made who do what"" no, the court did not force the payout, but they sure strongly encouraged Canada to settle, would you not agree?Trudeau said something that I think is particularly important in this discussion, and something that /r/metacanada tends to forget a great deal of the time. ""The Charter of Rights and Freedoms protects all Canadians, every one of us, even when it is uncomfortable."" The SCOC ruled that Canada failed Khadr.I'll leave you with an interesting thought exercise: If Harper had won in 2015 it's entirely plausible that the same outcome would have resulted.

"> “Like what anyone who isn’t an asshole does” so like you? We have fun and make jokes but because you don’t like it we are not allowed to.

Good. I think my biggest issue with these rape accusations is the time in between them. Like 30 fucking years? Get the fuck out of here those type of accusations shouldn't even be looked out without definitive proof. Bottom line if you get raped report it immediately.  If you do not report it then it is YOUR fault the rapest doesn't get justice. Also all accusations without definitive proof should be looked at as false untill a thorough investigation is done.  The accusations that have only dna and victim testimony as proof should result in both the victim and the accuser being put in lockup while a investigation is done. The victim and suspect should be cross examined Multiple times. This entire investigation should be private period. Any breach of that should result in harsh consequences.And the penalty for false accusations should be considered a felony and carry at least 2/3s of a rapest sentence.,1.0

Not just rogue elements or a singular villain controlling non-American forces behind the scenes, but where your average American, especially your average American soldier, is portrayed as being no different from a Nazi.Otherwise we would see OP (and Rami) praising games like Spec Ops: The Line (which u/DDE93 first mentioned) and Modern Warfare 2 (mentioned first by u/ArgosZz and u/Iswear12) for having an American be the villain. This may also be why we don't see OP (or Rami) praising Rising Storm 2 Vietnam (which u/babyrage2 mentioned). From what little I know about it Rising Storm 2 doesn't really *have* a hero and villain, it's faction-based multiplayer combat.It *could* be that OP just didn't know about those games or didn't think of them that way.

I was mad at Prince of Persia casting. Since I love those games, and know the character. Still haven't bothered to watch the movie. Also hated Fan4stic for racebending Johnny. That fundamentally changed character dynamics of a brother and sister. It's just retarded. People defended with with Alba ""not being white"" except she's half white so it's not really that comparable. generally I'm against it even if I don't know the character, since there's almost always existing characters they could use instead. See Starfire in Titans, when they could've just used Bumblebee if they wanted to use a black woman to play an ORANGE alien [that they didn't paint orange]. And there's always the option to invent a new character. I believe the Asian police officer in the new Spider-Man game was invented recently in the comics. But these people aren't creative. So they just swap races with existing characters. They could create the next Harley Quinn if they were talented, but they're devoid of talent.

">The factual statistics also suggest that a very large percentage of Muslims are socially and theologically conservative, and would favor laws that restrict our civil liberties in the name of their religion. A survey of British Muslims found that a supermajority thought homosexuality should be criminalized.Sure, they aren't necessarily jihadists. But if you believe in forcing society to live by Islamic norms even via the ballot box then you're an Islamist (""Jihadists"" are Islamists who support terrorism as a means to forcing society to live by Islamic norms).So are right-wing US Christians who believe that either homosexuality or abortion should be illegal, Christianists?They might never take part in any sort of activism to force their view on people, but there's no evidence to say that this ""supermajority"" of Muslims would do so, either (and in fact there is circumstantial evidence which shows they don't). Tommy Robinson may stop short of literally saying ""All Muslims are jihadists"" or ""all Muslims are extremists"" but he virtually says it, with weasel words. His (and others like him) line is ""Muslim is an extremist ideology"". Which has the implication that anyone who follows it is an extremist, whereas in fact the vast majority of Muslims clearly do not follow Islam to extremist lengths. >Think ""major, center-left social-democratic political parties,"" left-leaning MSM outlets, and most academics.I am sure you know full well that this is entirely subjective. Outlets like HuffPo and Guardian are generally considered ""left-leaning MSM"" but among right wing/alt-right circles they are often referred to as ""far left"" or even ""extremist"". As an example of how this also occurs on the right, Milo Yiannopolis works well - Milo is often at great pains to point out that he considers his views to be conservative-centrist, and in no way extreme. There are plenty on the left though, who considers some of the key beliefs he espouses - such as Muslims not being welcome in the West, and feminism being a dangerous ideology - as ""far right"". Personally I think a good indicator of whether an opinion/belief is extreme or moderate, is whether it involves imposing your will on other people. Hence ""Abortion should be illegal"" = extremeWhile""Everyone should have the choice whether or not to engage in abortion"" = moderate. That's a big part of the reason why I consider myself a liberal/progressive, rather than a conservative. To me, the liberal/progressive option is more often than not the one which involves giving people a choice, while the conservative/reactionary position is one which involves removing choice.

"Cop here: I also was suspicious of the 2%-10% claim. I’ve investigated dozens of sexual assault allegations and I can remember a handful that were true.I have absolutely had some true ones and it’s hard to explain, but I can usually tell pretty quickly when those are because the woman acts differently (and not how you’d expect). More so than how they act (I’ve had some [real] sexual assault victims act very quiet, or very sad, or very mad) but mainly their stories make sense.The false ones that I’ve investigated just don’t make sense and it’s blatantly obvious. The timelines don’t make sense, big plot points change, suspect description changes, or the suspect has definitive proof of the lie.I’ve commented on a case of mine before where when I talked to the suspect he showed me texts from the night in question from the “victim” saying no one could find out about them hooking up or her boyfriend would hear.Well the boyfriend heard and when I showed her the texts (from her to “suspect”) she just apologized and got up to leave the room (like that was going to be the end of it). Taking her to jail was very satisfying. Cops still should have due diligence to investigate all claims like they are true. I have sisters, a mother, and a wife and if some cop blew off a real assault I’d be furious. But IF the report is proven false, that person needs to go to jail.

"> I surely believe it's more needed there, but that doesnt mean that there arent quirks left that needs fine tuning in the west.Not in socialist Sweden. Here, when we change something, it's done through violence and fascism. Things I don't believe in. I don't need a suppressive government to change our way of life. That's never going to get us to a good place. > Take the wage gap for instance.I don't believe it's a issue in Sweden. It's frankly, not even real if you're doing a multi-varied analysis of the proposed issue. Women tend to pick lower paid jobs, and that's despite boys being prohibited from taking internships in fields outside of healthcare, and girls being forced to take internships at engineering fields. That's the sort of anti-individualistic fascism and social constructive ideas I don't want in a free country. And ashamed of what feminism did to this country. And the fact that every counter-argument whenever feminism is under criticism is ""you don't understand the issue"" in public forums here, is fucking damning.> But it does highlight some conservative values that still linger that that limits peoples choices through norms if not by rules.Yes, but to pretend conservative values only apply to gender differences is benign at best, idiotic at worst. The same conservative values is also why we respect religion despite it being a bunch of nonsense and why it's illegal to smoke weed, while 20 nicotine cigarettes and a bottle of vodka a day is acceptable as long as you come sober to work. I'm not saying there aren't bad conservatives values, but I'm saying that there's a lot of complex issues we have to fight, and I believe fighting them as a libertarian for freedom, is way better, than fighting gender questions separately by using the governments to point sticks.> Cause why do we have such a gap?Why do people choose different jobs? I do know, that there's way bigger gaps between rich and poor people, than there are between poor women, and poor men, as well as rich women and rich men. (talking about earnings here, specifically). But overall, I think it's a complex issue, and I've never heard any feminist ever state they need to think about it and do a proper analysis and reach a conclusion, the Swedish feminist, left, environmental and socialdemocratic party is convinced that there exists a systematic problem, which they can solve if given enough power. That's not fighting for equality, that's pretending communism works and ignoring the dangers of trying to change the world. > We put a lot of expectations on women, but being able to earn a lot is not what we expectSince when is expectations bad? And who are we? I don't like being spoken for, and I'd say men in general need to be held under higher expectations, not that women should be feeling less expectations. But overall, I'd say, it's a liberal issue, everyone should be held at the expectations that they can reasonable be able to manage, as individuals. > Right wingers dont want women to have access to abortions or for kids to get sexual education(which makes the girls end up pregnant)Wrong, you're asserting American-centric politics here. Right-wings and left-wingers doesn't mean the same thing to us. Here in Sweden, even the Swedish Democratic Party (the nationalists) who want to ban all immigrants and throw them out, are pro-abortion. Literally 95% of Sweden is pro-abortion, it's **never** been a question here about yes or no. It's been ""how late?"" from the very start, we're a extremely non-religious country, even our ""Christian democratic party"" isn't anti-abortion. See how different cultures can be even in the west? I assume you didn't know that, which is fine, Sweden is a very small country, but I think it's dangerous to look at conservative views and assume they're dangerous or good, because they're different from where you're standing. We have conservative views in Sweden I question heavily which nobody can defend, simply because we don't even talk about conservative values, we just stay quiet about subjects that falls under that term. Drug use for example. It's just not discussed anywhere. And whenever it is discussed, it's whataboutism, in it's worst way. But you can't claim right-wingers want a certain thing because that's just not true in the west. The only ones who are fighting for things like anti-abortion laws are Islamists. And it's lefties politicians who let those into our political system. I'm not against immigration, but I am heavily against segregation that leads to poor integration into society. We have huge subgroups in Sweden who never learn Swedish, we have people following religious conservative values and practices which are illegal here, and our socialist government isn't doing anything because of how afraid everyone is to be branded as a bigot or racist for calling out shitty ideas and behavior. edit: I'd love to keep the discussion going, but I'm heading home for work now, have a great day!

"It actually doesn't make much sense to put a woman in prison who is non-violent and unlikely to re-offend.

Prisons are criminal schools. Plus it costs a lot of money to keep someone in prison.

It makes more sense to give them treatment, and only give a prison sentence for re-offenders.But I don't understand why they are singling out women. The policy surely makes sense for men as well?

I decided to play with it a bit more.  After testing, oddly,  I don't think this is a case of google modifying specific search results but a broad sweep which may have some other reason for being in place;   See here: http://google.com/search?q=pedophile+site%3Areddit.comThis works and displays results.  For me the first result is Total POS admits to being a pedophileNow if I search for pedophile POS it should work,  right? http://google.com/search?q=POS+pedophile+site%3Areddit.comSo we know a known result is not coming back with proper search terms. Edit 3:  it seems ANY COMBINATION of [word] + pedophile has no results.  Not sure why that happens but it is NOT specifically related to biden,  except that biden is a [word] + pedophile.    Using one of the most common words in english,  ""The"" we can see this results in the same no results: http://google.com/search?q=the+pedophile+site%3Areddit.comI think this at least dismisses the idea that google is directly modifying search results for a specific and focused purpose in this.  Frankly this is much more confusing than that would be,  I really do wonder why it is setup as such, It seems a bad method to avoid politically searches as such, when you can just do: https://www.google.com/search?q=biden+kids+site%3Areddit.comand the second result for me is ""joe biden is a pedophile"" with numerous more results trailing down.   I think this puts the idea they're using this specific case mentioned by the poster above for this purpose.  They may modify results or other nefarious and biased things,  but this particular case, it isn't happening.   Please when you make claims, look deeper.  Otherwise we become just like those media asshats we don't like,  the ones who jump to conclusions and scream RACIST, SEXIST, or POLITICAL FALSE NARRATIVE!  Let's not be them.

Looking at Call of Duty and how your character dies more often than surviving I can argue against that.Or Bioshock Infinite where Levine tries to go all cryptic with the ending I knew how it was going to end with the protagonist dying.Or Last of Us where Joel damns humanity to selfishly save Ellie only for her to lose what little idealism she had in the sequel.Or Dead Space Awakening where the franchise not only dies but humanity utterly fails to stop the necromorphsWhat the tranny cunt wants is something where the actions of the protagonist dont matter. Stalingrad vs Grave of the Firelies is a good comparison of how the the tone of death reflects on the endong. In Grave of The Fireflies. The brother and sister dies but kobe lives on as they realize in spite of it all their deaths are not in vain and the city will find hope again. In Stalingrad 1993 movie. Riesler and Wiesz dies in the cold as the credit reel rolls. Ending it on a sad note.They want Stalingrad 1993 as the example of pessimistic stories in gaming.

"I'm certain I could find a ton of stories of kids being stupid with makeshift capes. That's not the point though. The point is that kids absolutely do want to emulate Superman's morals. They use those stories as a way of determining how they act around others. A story about a very fantastical interaction is going to create an idea of fantasy. I'm sure little girls want to become mermaids, the same as boys want to become superman, the difference is interpersonal relationships.Generally speaking a familial relationship is viewed entirely differently. A kid generally doesn't watch their parents go on dates, they don't watch their parents fall in love. Even those with a broken household still aren't sitting in on their mother's date with suitor #2. The nuance of attraction is being simulated with camera work and sound in movies and tv shows.Kids are attracted to colors, not so much stories. Designing a story with pink colours but doesn't feature a relationship is absolutely doable and I don't think people take issue with it. It's the shows that are pink in colour and are pushing some tumultuous, romantic subplot that become a problem. Boy Meets World is about a kid, his brother and best friend screwing around. Season 3 introduces a romantic subplot that's treated in a fairly healthy way throughout the rest of the series.

"> Are we sure about this? If people argue for socially liberal positions such as - being pro-choice on abortion, legalisation of cannabis, rehabilitation of offenders rather than incarceration/ death penalty, legalisation of gay marriage, racial and gender equality - are they really called ""right wing"" ? Because to me, that statement seems to fly in the face of reality. I would say that people who take those positions are generally referred to as left wing or liberal, particularly by right wing commentators.I was specifically referring to free speech absolutism. That's a liberal position. It has been redefined as ""right wing"" in today's culture war, by those who consider themselves progressive leftists.>This one is very easy to debunk. Here's a link to a report on how Amnesty International (usually regarded as a liberal organisation) has campaigned against FGM and the treatment of women in Islamic societies.Sure. But when people like Ayaan Hirsi Ali do the same thing they're accused of being ""right wing extremists."" As is Maajid Nawaz even though he's of the moderate left. Even Christopher Hitchens, who was a *literal Trotskyist*, got accused of being an 'extreme right winger' for his stances on the Islamic world's treatment of gays and women. Sure, maybe it doesn't happen every time. But you can't pretend that people who express concern over how bad civil liberties are in the Islamic world and suggest that perhaps Islam, at least in the form in which it is most prominent, is standing in the way of liberalization/modernization *don't* get accused of being racist or xenophobic or ""right-wingers."">Here's a story about Femen - again definitely a left wing organisation - protesting treatment of women in Islamic societies.I am not familiar with Femen but from what little I've heard they don't count as a mainstream/'official' organ of the establishment left.

Yes, the character does not REALLY want to sully his hands due to the conflicting feelings he has, but he didn't really have to do the work himself, and the show goes out of its way to demonstrate that he WOULDN'T do it himself. So why is the almighty lord of darkness, the king of fucking vampires, not cracking the whip on the Vamp Spice Girls and telling them ""Do this, do that, no questions""? Something that, in turn, would make Carmilla's scheming actually mean something, because she would have to find a way around Dracula's unbreaking resolve, and twist his plans to fit her agenda.And if you want an aswer: you can say the exact same thing about Darling in the FranXX, that ""it was the point"", but the inconsistencies and faux depth don't make that show any less shit, and definitely do not help in regards to Castlevania, even if it's still a good show, IMO.",0.0

">Jesus you are dense. Do tell.>  Assuming I think male rape victims are more privileged that women because I claim to be a feminist is absolutely retarded.I didn't. I said feminism has always tried to benefit women before men even when men were worse off. Like male rape and abuse victims. Feminism has bought a lot of attention to female victims while ignoring and sometimes actively silencing efforts to help male victims, who were already screwed over by comparison to women before feminism even existed.If feminism was about equality, it would devote more than a fraction of it's effort to helping male victims. It does not. It regularly genders rape and abuse as ""violence against women"" by men. I've had lots of discussions with feminists, and a lot of them just say it's men's job to get support for themselves. Even though feminism often says *everyone* should support female victims, and women's shelters even get government support.According to some feminists, men aren't really systemically discriminated against when they do report, they're just too sexist to admit they were victimized, like women. The irony never seems to register.> I already emphasized the nuanced difference and you still ram it down that if I use the word feminism I can’t possibly agree that some men have had a hard go.No, I don't.

Westerns are a complex and problematic genre tied to a violent history that gave rise to the myth of the gun as an egalitarian tool (e.g., the oft-quoted “God made man, Sam Colt made them equal”) and rugged, self-reliant masculinity. As a result, interactions with *Red Dead Redemption 2*’s NPCs exist within that masculine framework. Arthur and the player’s actions are expressions of a mythic masculinity. We rescue women and lesser men—after all, better men would be able to fight off bandits and manage their horses— and compete against would-be gunslingers while using unique abilities like Dead-Eye to our advantage.

Most of your questions are answered in there and there's not much point to me re-hashing it to you. You're mostly asking me about facts that could easily be found in a newspaper. The former Yale classmate was in [this WSJ article that I also linked above](https://www.wsj.com/articles/kavanaugh-fight-in-state-of-uncertainty-1538401675?mod=searchresults&page=1&pos=1) but here's [the full text of his statement](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/30/us/politics/chad-ludington-statement-brett-kavanaugh.html). Four years ago, Kavanaugh himself [reminisced about binge drinking in college](http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-na-pol-kavanaugh-drinking-20180925-story.html) and his [high school yearbook was full of references to alcohol](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/24/business/brett-kavanaugh-yearbook-renate.html) and the attitude and decision-making behind the ""Renate Alumni"" thing is horrific. And let's get real, [Brett Kavanaugh was definitely the inspiration for ""Bart O’Kavanaugh""](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2018/09/27/mark-judges-book-validates-christine-fords-timeline-alleged-kavanaugh-assault/?noredirect=on&utm_term=.2affad39e45e) in Mark Judge's book.>Ok, share.I'm not sure what you're asking me.>I don't have to.I don't understand what you're trying to say here. Again, it's hard to get a bearing on what you're saying because you're really not making any points. What makes you believe that Ford would have stepped forwards when she was 16 if the story is true? You seem to agree that we know not all women do who later seem to have valid claims, so not having stepped forward does not necessarily mean the story is made up.It's within the scope of the FBI's powers to give a report to the Senate, because that was the background check. You are telling me to cite (not ""site"" btw) a source that the FBI has the authority to produce a background check that was requested of it for the Senate.>She was fine for his entire career before he was nominated.Yes, dude. Do you not know what a civic duty is? It's an obligation not to yourself, but to your country, a burden of good citizenship like voting or serving on a jury. The transcripts are online, but the relevant sentence of Ford's testimony is, ""I thought it was my civic duty to relay the information I had about Mr. Kavanaugh’s conduct so that those considering his potential nomination would know about the assault."" You could have consulted a dictionary or listened to Ford's testimony.>This happened to both of them.Again, the civic duty thing changed the balance. I think (hope) that we agree that these kinds of allegations should not be made lightly and should not be taken lightly. The consequences of both airing out a false allegation and of suppressing a real one are severe. It's inherently a balancing act, so, yes, both of their lives are now set before the court of public opinion. Kavanaugh, however, is a public figure, so he put himself out there by nature of his occupation choices, but that's a minor point. I think the bigger point is just that *this is the nature of our adversarial system of law.* The point I was trying to make about the embarrassment and publicness of these allegations, investigations, and prosecutions is not that they shouldn't happen (although we should be cautious, and they've kind of gotten out of hand recently), but that they are an understandable deterrent. I'm not making an argument for whether or not it should change. That's a whole other conversation. I'm making the argument that in light of this, it is understandable why a real victim might not step forwards *until the added conviction that it is her civic duty* tipped the balance in favor of stepping forwards even so many years afterwards.You're missing the point about the supplemental FBI investigation. It was excessively limited in scope and a weak defense for the argument that Kavanaugh never did any of the things alleged. Avenati's trashy (he was Stormy Daniels' attorney, for reference), but that was a side-comment/personal opinion and no excuse for the FBI not even interviewing him or his client. Do you really believe that the supplemental investigation was sufficient? What makes you believe that?I don't think you follow the news, dude. I heard the 20% thing on NPR, but you can Google it, or just do the math on the source I did cite you to immediately afterwards yourself. I'm in law school, so I'm also busy. I didn't listen to all of the testimonies live, but I did stream it afterwards. You're getting defensive because you haven't kept up with this issue as well as you could have.

It saddens me. She was a amazingly well behaved baby- but then again she was around her mother too much, my brother didn't really give much of a fuck, and we couldn't take care of her besides infrequently.I wonder, if someone who wasn't her cunt mother or random foster care raised her if she could have turned out okay.

"Briar Rose/Aurora/Sleeping Beauty disobeys the fairies. She’s separated from her parents as a baby for her safety, doesn’t even know them.*Beauty and the Beast* is one that you absolutely need to see, the animated version is one of Disney’s greatest movies, if not the single best. It was the first animated film ever nominated for Best Picture at the Academy Awards, quite deservedly so (but it lost quite fairly to *The Silence of the Lambs* -- nothing had a chance with that kind of competition) and very noticeably contributed to the creation of the Best Animated Picture category. The recent live-action adaptation is watchable by the strength of its source material but it's very bloated, partially because of the completely unnecessary effort to establish Belle as having some kind of engineering skill (when she's already a standout by virtue of being an imaginative bookworm in a provincial village) and establish the villain's shitty little sidekick as gay representation (which was *horrendous*, he's like a walking minstrel show, and his switch to being a good guy in the middle of the third act is plainly forced and nonsensical to the point that the movie *even makes a joke about it*).Belle *definitely* has a father here, in fact his fuckup kicks off the plot — Belle goes out looking for her father after he foolishly takes a wrong turn on the road and wanders into the Beast’s castle, where he is taken prisoner by the Beast (her father’s horse returns without him and then takes Belle back). Belle, against her father’s wishes, offers to be the Beast’s prisoner in her father’s place, and her father returns to town raving about it all hoping to rally help to free her. Everyone assumes her father is crazy, so Belle and the Beast have time for most of the rest of the movie to happen.Persona is extremely and deliberately archetypal, it’s absolutely packed with stuff from Carl Jung.

">The argument is that male tennis players having a tantrum aren't penalised to the extent that Serena was penalisedExcept that argument is retarded. Even if it were true (despite statistically data showing it isnt) men wouldnt gain any benefit. How so? Well if a woman is penalized more and thus disadvantaged for having a tantrum then their female opponent has more of an advantage. On the flip side, if a man is penalized less for having a tantrum and thus gain an advantage, then his male opponent has more of a disadvantage because their opponent wasnt penalized as much as they should have been. In either case there is no net change in advantage, just in the case of women the one receiving the penalizing would be the disadvantaged party and for men the one whose opponent wasnt penalized when they should have been is the disadvantaged party. Either way there is no net change. The only time the argument would possibly make sense is if1. Men played women2. It was true in the first place (despite statistics showing over the past 20 years men have receiced 3x more violations than women) If number 2 is true without number 1 it cant be called sexist as in either case a man or a woman is disadvantaged just as much as their opponent is advantaged, just the side that is advantaged switches from the one throwing the tantrum to the one whose opponent throws the tantrum",0.0

You are ending a human life, and you shouldn’t. > Or is from some religious moral high ground?While I am personally religious, I think it’s pretty easily to justify a pro-life position from a secular ethics standpoint: this is a genetically unique human life, which within weeks of conception has a beating heart. If we believe in the inherent value of human life, then we cannot justify ending it, especially not at that stage of its existence.> Well I hope your educating the fuck out of these kids or giving them a shit load of cash because when they're adults and they can't get a job they're fucked because 1, the US welfare system is shite. 2,  they better not get Illl because your hospital system is shite and 3, I hope they aren't black because the US obviously seems to have a huge problem with adult black men from broken homes (aren't they statistically to either die young or spend the majority of their lives in prison?)This is an interesting screed. So, I take it you don’t live in the U.S., then? 1) If not, I’d ask you mind your own business and let us Americans handle our own affairs. If you are, then do something about it. Teach kids life skills, help out your fellow human beings. Stop waiting for the government to take care of you. 2) This line of logic is absurd. If it can be used to justify abortion, it can be used to justify euthanasia and any other type of “mercy” killing. Life is just too awful and bleak and miserable and we’d be better off if we just died without even having a chance to experience it. Is that right?> You might we'll look after kids but as I said, come 18 no-one gives a fuckBut that’s not what you said. Regardless, who stops caring? Is this all about the government again? Does anything exist for you folks outside of welfare? Just go out and be good to people. Why does it have to be about how big the dole is? People live better on average today than at almost any other point in history. And it’s still horrible enough to justify killing our own children?",0.0

We knew we couldn't make it illegal to be either against the war or black, but by getting the public to associate the hippies with marijuana and blacks with heroin, and then criminalizing both heavily, we could disrupt those communities.

"> There are verses in the Quran that actually condemn Hadith by name. That's not correct either. Hadith is the collective word used for the sayings and deeds of the Prophet Muhammad (SAW). And this is what the Quran says about the actions of the Prophet:**Indeed in the Messenger of Allâh (Muhammad SAW) you have a good example to follow, for him who hopes for (the Meeting with) Allâh and the Last Day and remembers Allâh much. (33:21)** If the Prophet didn't shake hands with women, it makes sense for Muslims (who are told that he is a good example to follow) to do the same and refrain from shaking hands with people of the opposite gender.And if that seems extreme, consider this next verse: **""It may be that you dislike a thing which is good for you and that you like a thing which is bad for you. Allâh knows but you do not know."" (2:216)**Since a Muslim believes in Allah, they also believe that His knowledge and wisdom are infinite. So if Allah has prohibited this action, as depicted by His Prophet, there's wisdom in that prohibition. The fact that we may or may not be able to grasp that doesn't change its value.",0.0

"I have no comment on any of the articles written about the presentation, because I didn't read them. I formed my opinion by reading the presentation itself. I disagree with this video's assessment that the presentation isn't as bad as it's made out to be.The premises in the presentation are that censorship by the platform owner [is acceptable](https://imgur.com/Q4vdZAl) provided the rules and effects are clear, is  [politically neutral, and focused on tone](https://imgur.com/rk9BYjJ), They see the platform owners as ""[hospitality organizers](https://imgur.com/WVShVvU)"". I reject these premises. For one, I don't see google/twitter/facebook any more a ""hospitality organizer"" than I see my email provider: they provide a service by which I may communicate with others. The standards I use to communicate with friends are vastly different than those I use for business contacts, and I neither expect nor desire those standards to be enforced by the email provider.Secondly, these providers [already see themselves as politically neutral](http://archive.is/ExxVO) and focused on tone, so following those guidelines just gives us more of the same. And of course tone itself isn't politically neutral: see the censoring of the legal term [""illegal aliens""](http://archive.is/Xe0AC) (though to their credit they appear to have backed off on that decision). Or the infamous ""gender pronouns"" debate. If I call a M2F transgender person ""he"", is that ""tone"" (and subject to censorship), ""political"" (and not subject to censorship), or a giant grey area subject to the whims of the censor and how they feel about me and/or the subject on any given day?Thirdly, being transparent about why you'e censoring someone doesn't really help the person being censored that much. We know exactly why The Daily Stormer was deplatformed: the GoDaddy CEO woke up one day and said ""I hate these guys and want them off my site"". When Alex Jones was deplatformed there were news articles and official statements on standby to tell us why it happened. When has such transparency ever answered more questions than it raised? You're still trying to polish the turd that is highly subjective standards with the shine of ""policy"" and ""procedure"".Fourthly, what if I don't want these platforms to ""police tone""? So far they have a shit track record in policing their platforms; why should I trust them in the future? Earlier the presentation poses the question ""by what right do you do this?"". They try to answer it by saying ""well we'll only focus on tone"", but the question remains: ""by what right are you the arbiter of 'tone'?""Fifthly, if there is a problem with ""tone"", why enforce a top-down, one size fits all approach to it? Why not empower the users with more advanced tools to filter things themselves (or for others with their consent) without removing the ""offensive"" material from the platform. Filter lists and moderated feeds could be services provided by users, for users and under the total control (including the ability to modify filter lists, opt-in/out of them, and ultimately disable all filtering/moderation) of the end-user. That way people can tailor their experience to suit their own sensibilities rather than having one standard thrust onto everyone.Finally, I love the use of ""family friendly"" terms. When Germany censors things it's to [""make online spaces safer""](https://imgur.com/9G9oAju), but when ""dictatorial leaders"" want to do so it's to [""improve their methods of control""](https://imgur.com/VHMwhT1). And on the [page](https://imgur.com/sejtdVp) where they discuss flagging porn (which has regulations around providing access to children) and malware (which has quantifiable harmful effects) they provide a case study of The Daily Stormer (who was engaged in legal if unpopular speech) being taken off the internet, thereby trying to create a (strained) association between the three.",1.0

You know the real Jews written of in the bible not a I think Germanic tribe that adopted the religion for most political cohesion reason  IIRC in about 1100 or so during the Crusades because the Christians and Muslims were busy murderating each other?My Uncle(by marriage) is an ordained Rabbi, not sure if he is ethnic European Jewish, kind of looks it but I dunno, he's a decent sort. Anyway getting back off the tangent, what is it say more about them that they think only Jews can be Marxists, and that all Jews are Marxists?If you asked my uncle he would vehemently deny that philosophy, possibly quite angrily, and say that every Jew that not only doesn't practice- but especially takes up Marxism is a disgrace to the race(I am guessing I can't say for sure and possibly I shouldn't put words in his mouth) and would almost certainly call Karl Marx an evil man. He said he looked into the Koran some(translations I assume) and was dismayed and said it was nothing but hatefulness and brutality.While being raised Christian, Baptist if it matters though I haven't gone to church in decades, and if I am still Christian I think I may be a poor one who need to put in more effort, I learned some from my uncle. One because he reads Hebrew, I think he said he was working on the Aramaic but wasn't there yet. But he was Messianic so I assume he follows the new testament as well.Anyone few things I learned.It is **not** Thou shalt not kill. The word is actually *murder* not kill. Which does make sense given the fact blessings and such were given in battle, so I assume it's like a self defense thing. Jesus is a complete mistranslated and it's Yeshua in Aramaic. Yehoshua in Hebrew, and Joshua or Ioshua if you want to get before the 1600s or so. He says he has no idea where that translation comes from.Jehovah is not only a translation but is an INSULTING term and completely blasphemous thing to call the Almighty. Hell is not the place for eternal torment, and does in fact basically just mean a hole in the earth- basically a grave, so yeah everyone *is* going to hell. What we think of as ""hell"" was always called ""the lake of fire"".Also apparently ""God helps those who help themselves"" at least in words near directly to that is not anywhere in the bible. Found that out last time I saw him.Also he suggests that Kosher proscription against meat and dairy being in the same dish was too broadly applied and that it's okay and the passage was not to ""Boil a kid in it's mother's milk.""

"Get a load of this fucking retard... Let me attempt to explain (probably unsuccessfully) to your shit for brains what I mean.1) I'm sick and tired of idiots disrespecting the source material in the name of ""muh duh-ver-see-tee"" and virtue signaling. Particularly Americunts such as Hollywood. If you want to make your ""diverse utopia"", do it on your own, make up your own story, don't bastardize existing source material. And it's always - *always* - race swap from white to whatever other color and from male to female. Even if it doesn't make *any* sense whatsoever and even if actually completely breaks the established lore which was the case with Idris Elba in The Dark Tower where racism was actually a big plot in the source material and in fact it was what you liberal morons would call ""reverse racism"" of a black person hating a white person for being white.Another insane example is that batshit absurd bullshit remake they are trying to make of the Lord of the Flies with *all female cast*. In what universe does it make sense (well in your demented NPC brain it probably does) to convert the all male cast to all female cast and not destroy the core and the fundamental idea of the source material? Well, ""diversifying"" the Witcher cast makes just about the same amount of sense (for people too stupid to breathe like you this means ""none"").2) The Witcher is essentially the first or at least the most famous story that comes from Eastern Europe and popularizes our Slavic mythology and culture. I am an Eastern European Slav myself. And yes, it may come as a complete surprise to your ""progressive"" shit for brains, but we do have our own culture for about ~1500 years, give or take a few hundred. And let me tell you what hasn't changed for these 15+ centuries. We don't have ""diverse"" people. In fact we happen to be some of the whitest motherfuckers in existence, proly only the Scandinavians are whiter. I'm so very sorry it ""hurts"" your Western politically correct ""duh-ver-see-tee"" and ""inclusivity"" bullshit but this is **OUR** culture and if you don't like it you can go fuck yourself, preferably with a rusty fork shoved deep inside your anus. I guess ""all cutlures are equal and beautiful"" except yours, yours is too white, we need to ""diversify"" it a little so we can pat ourselves on the back how ""progressive"" we are so that the western feminists social justice retards don't REEEEEEEEE.So what, we are not allowed to have our own culture? It's not ""diverse"" and ""inclusive"" enough for you? Well, I'm sorry, but being the ""original slaves"" we didn't have much time to ""diversify"" it so that early 21st century millennial NPCs won't be triggered by our evil demonic ""whiteness"". I'm absolutely sure that you wouldn't mind if we make a reboot of the African Shaka Zulu series and cast Channing Tatum in the role of King Shaka? I'm also absolutely certain that you loved Gods of Egypt and its ""authentic"" cast.So just like you liberal lunatics love to spew this ""whitewashing"" crap, can I also ask to stop ""darkwashing"" **MY** culture? It's not like Slavic culture is that popular and mainstream in the west. We have this one thing and you just have to fuck it all up because of your ""duh-ver-see-tee"" and ""progressive-ness"".3) Triss canon hair color is not red, it's chestnut, dumbass. And she is ""best girl"" (you NPCs really can't meme) because I love her character from the books. She is my favorite character in the entire series.

Sure, they can read some funny dialogue and overact to make it work for the SNL crowd, but that’s it. They’re *acting* funny, they’re not actually funny. There is a difference.

There's not much reason to do the same to a whole state.  Recognize the elected leadership as a summary of certain balances and proportions of opinion, yes, but recognize it as only that.  We should address it as what it is. 'Just nuke California' is probably about as meaningless and unhelpful as 'just genocide all white people.'   Just emotion and stigma.

"Yes, I know it's free online. What I'm trying to communicate, via hyperbole, is that much of the coverage by pro journalists has been misguided in focusing on 16/206 negative accounts/tweets that were identified and described as Russian Trolls. And that this is out of around 1000 total ""analyzed"" tweets. My own digging has been focused on that angle too, and this linked article also focuses on the Russian Trolls angle, because that's what the misguided other journos were getting wrong.Most other GGers that would come and comment on an AMA thread have no idea what the study actually is looking at, or can describe why the methodology or analysis is wrong. We can all point at the journos who reported on the study WRONG, but we'd find ourselves in agreement with the researcher on that front. The angle you pointed out is something pretty interesting that I hadn't considered. Whether further study would separate the tweets into ""pre-GG"" and ""post-GG"" engagement. To me, it's obvious that there's something meaningful to be gleaned from the study about ""see, this is why you don't gather tweets in this manner and look at them in complete isolation completely manually"", but how much of that will be discussed civilly with the the author compared to how many of us will just call him a liberal shill for his study on Muh Russian Hackers?Who's going to just have all the proof they need on hand? I don't know. Maybe this dude has literally never ever been on the bad side of twitter and can't make meaningful casual observations that are super obvious to degenerates like me or the author of this piece: >Just from using the platform casually, in my experience tagging people in Twitter is pretty uncommon and ""@-ing"" someone is a method of communication disproportionately used by trolls who get their kicks knowing that you get a notification of their message. The average Twitter user tweets something like ""I don't like Star Wars,"" the average troll tweets ""@rianjohnson you ruined my childhood you overrated hack.""It would be pretty embarassing to see him get completely and casually btfo by us and our degenerately deep knowledge of our community, but I think he's more likely to find a bunch of idiots who haven't/can't read, but have already formed a misguided opinion based on the misguided reporting.Edit: ... Thinking back on it, the ""know you're gay"" is also a super casual BTFO for anyone who has actually read it. I didn't catch that because once I saw that he was taking individual tweets to summarize a person's entire online persona, I was only skimming it for @ handles. I'm basically illiterate.

"I can't find any sources that this ""urban legend"" is false, and it seems to be cited a lot in research papers -- and researchers even will outright assert that the difference is not caused by a failure of intent to die. So I think I'd trust the researchers slightly more than /u/Blutarg.However, some of the [most cited](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/The-depressed-patient-and-suicidal-patient-in-the-Chang-Gitlin/25c937bfe845f9f133d794b5f2c917df114ecf67) stuff to this effect is very vulnerable to double and even quintuple counting. For this reason anywhere I read that says women are twice (or more) as likely to attempt I am skeptical of. For instance, [this website](https://afsp.org/about-suicide/suicide-statistics/), cites 1.2x based on the 2016 National Survey of Drug Use and Mental Health, so if there is a valid result that legitimately pegs it at over 2x, there is so much variance in our data that we have to question what we know. Moreover there at least some woozling going on at least in the non-acedemic sphere, since wikipedia links to [this](https://books.google.ca/books?id=db9OHpk-TksC&pg=PA191&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q&f=false) as supposed evidence that women attempt suicide more than men, when the book references a survey of living people where women were more likely to have attempted suicide by an unstated amount.On the whole, I don't have any data that suggests men attempt suicide more than women, and I do have data of varying quality that suggests that women attempt suicide more than men.",0.0

The law was upheld to be valid as long as the work is deemed [obscene per the miller test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miller_test) in both the [Whorley](http://www.ca4.uscourts.gov/Opinions/Published/064288.P.pdf) and [Handley](https://web.archive.org/web/20081019165828/http://www.iasd.uscourts.gov/iasd/opinions.nsf/55fa4cbb8063b06c862568620076059d/20a96a77c04347ed86257480006ae8c5/$FILE/Handley.pdf) cases. The Handley case did cite that the sections that don't also require the work to be deemed obscene were too overbroad but they also cited that, ""This conclusion has minimal impact on this case given the almost complete redundancy of the conduct criminalized by subsections 1466A(a)(1) and (b)(1) (SIC: The sections requiring obscenity) with that of subsections 1466A(a)(2) and (b)(2) (SIC: The sections not requiring obscenity)."" Other sections have also already [survived a supreme court challenge](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/07pdf/06-694.pdf).>All the convictions also involve actual child pornography so it doesn't count.  [No they aren't all like that.](https://www.mlive.com/news/muskegon/index.ssf/2017/01/prisoner_gets_two_years_more_a.html). You can find some searching the [court archives of them too](https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/search/search.action?na=&se=&sm=&flr=&ercode=&dateBrowse=&govAuthBrowse=&collection=&historical=false&st=content%3A1466a+appeal&psh=50&sbh=&tfh=&originalSearch=content%3A1466a+appeal&fromState=advSearch&sb=dno&ps=50&sb=re&ps=50). It's important to keep in mind that DA's typically like to charge you with anything they can think of and see what sticks. Being convicted of this law along with other violations doesn't negate the fact that loli pornography, which is going to be deemed obscene, is still illegal all on it's own. Also it's important to realize that prosecutions for this are really rare. It's typically used as a way to add time to a sentence or as a way to get you for something if their original accusations fail in a similar fashion to how Al Capone was convicted of tax evasion.>If prosecutions are so rare than it doesn't matter.  It's true the prosecutions are rare, as LewdGamer's essay clearly outlined. It's as likely for a private citizen nobody to get caught solely for this as they are of being caught downloading movies off a bit torrent. However keep in mind that is only going to apply ""nobodies"". Public corporations and public figures are under greater scrutiny. Just because you likely won't get caught doesn't mean a publicly traded company can publicly allow it. It's very similar to how you will not see public companies endorsing piracy. ",0.0

"In regards to games journalists? When Dragon Age 2 came out I was pumped. I looked at the BioWare devs acting like fucking clowns and brushed it off. (Although, ""When you press a button, something something awesome has to happen. Button. Awesome. Connect."" is permanently burned into the part of my brain that responds to cringe.) Still pumped. Then I played it. I remember the exact moment I raised an eyebrow. It was in Kirkwalls lowdown at night, and I'd just dispatched a group of enemies. Then another one appeared out of nowhere. Then I turned the corner and the exact same thing happened. These combat encounters littered the game. And it's not the good kind of combat encounter that's fun. It's the bad kind that's only there to make it difficult to walk from point A to point B and pad out the length of the game. And speaking of padding out the length, there were so many fucking reused levels. It's really not funny. Like, no other game I can think of has such poor variety in levels. But fuck it, I'll enjoy the story....Oh wait, **there isn't one.**And I don't mean ""The story is bad."" I mean it doesn't fucking exist. It's just a series of disjointed events that somehow explode into a war and also that trinket you found in the deep roads was super important. Aren't you glad we told you nothing about it? But... Well the original dragon age had a kind of disjointed story too, I suppose. I guess I'll enjoy the characters. Let's see... You don't get points for keeping combining the best parts of Awakening. Because we've already played awakening. Fenris is... No. Isabella is... I gave her to the Arishok on every playthrough because if she's gonna cause a bunch of Chad's to invade a city because someone stole their nerd book she really is too dumb to live.Merrill gave meaning to the phrase ""Burn it before it lays eggs."" In my mind. So no, Dragon Age 2 was BioWares worst showing to date in my mind. So I decided to check the reviews...Boss, the reviews were glowing. All of them.And I sat and thought about this for a while, how can something that came from a formula they'd knocked out of the park on the first try, then fucked it up so hard, be so well liked?Then I saw all the ads running on the pages for the reviews. They were Dragon Age 2 ads. Then I realised. ""Oh, these motherfuckers are bought and paid for.""Haven't taken their opinions seriously since. That makes it what, 7 or 8 years almost? ",1.0

He is, or at least was, a very talented comic book with an impressive and influential body of work.  His run on *The Flash* turned a whiny sidekick into a real hero over the course of several years.  He wrote *Kingdom Come*, one of the most recognized of DC's Elseworlds books/series.  He's very nearly on the same level as guys like Peter David or Neil Gaiman.

She wanted the marriage. She got it. She was unhappy. She wanted the divorce. She got it. She's still unhappy. He's found someone new and moved on without her, and she's even more unhappy.

"> Just reading all the stupidity going on over there and now being able to point out how retarded they were was pissing me offPretty much exactly the ridiculousness we're going to face. I guarantee I disagree with most of the people in this sub about so many things, but I also disagree with everyone everywhere about a fuckload of things. I like to consider both sides of every balance, but the illogical reality is that every Yin/Yang argument has the majority of people yelling either White or Black, meanwhile, they're ignorant to the fact that the heart of their own argument is the opposite color. When people see women as victims constantly deserving support, they're literally falling prey to our evolved desires to support and protect women, and while that's natural and fair, it's normally tied to a lot of freedom from the male side of the equation. As it stands now, men are being demonized, financially damaged, culturally ostracized, and unconditionally hated for being weak. Men are naturally expected to be strong, but society is basically no longer allowing us to do that in many natural ways. We're still demanded to be the assertive pursuers of dating, then the hypergamous reality of women still has them dating up, all while we're being shamed for being ""incels"" like that's somehow new. It should be blatantly considered promotion of ""toxic masculinity"" to *call* people incels, yet it's what's happening culturally. And if you're strong and assertive, you better do it all perfectly in the right way and toward the right person, because otherwise you're going to be seen as a violent predator and demonized for thinking about the thing that caused every fucking one of us to exist. It's absolute insanity. I'm looking at these internet attitudes mainly, but these hiveminds *will* dictate the future of our culture. We're being trained by shills and plenty of other seamy groups into a state of purely hateful division, and it's disgusting to see this from my perspective as a humanist. All that matters to me is the chance to share a balanced perspective between different arguments, but what's happening? Slowly, my one account, when I'm ""not allowed"" to make alts for risk of being shadowbanned, is being ostracized sub by sub based on the whims of a few people who control the conversation of millions.",0.0

"Eh... they're basically saying that their motives were political rather than genuine dislike for the movie. Were that the case, I would understand them claiming that the bad reviews are illegitimate. But I don't believe that to be the case. I believe it was a really bad movie that lots of people hated, lots of people loved (probably because they are political activists ironically) and a few people were luke warm on. They literally went out of their way to shit all over the OT characters who so many Star Wars fans loved and grew up with. I'm not a big SW fan, but if they did this shit to LOTR I'd be just as fucking disgusted as they are. The fact that they didn't even dedicate a moment of the movie to Luke finding out Han was dead and his reaction to that is a fucking disgrace. But it would have made Luke a somewhat sympathetic character and they were all in on making Luke a fucking retard loser so that Rey can look good by comparison, just as they did with all the others OT characters for the same purpose. For that reason alone, I have no idea how they didn't expect a large portion of the fanbase to absolutely hate this movie. It blows my mind how ungrateful they are towards the fanbase that turned SW into a cashcow. They honestly believe that people OWE them their money.",0.0

With all Star, I view it as ""This is a version of Bruce who is still mentally 8 years old who promised to spend his life warring on criminals and acting on it regardless of what others think."" and partially what I always viewed Bruce Wayne generally as. They rescinded it because of fainting couch PTA types, It wasn't because that's where they wanted to go, it's because their publishers had pressure put on them, same with Moulton and how he used S&M in wonder woman.

"Yes, because the only way in which words/usages are right or wrong is by the judgement of the speaker or listeners. It is possible and downright *acceptable* for listeners to judge that speakers usage of a word is wrong.Dictionaries neither endorse nor condemn, they only care about existence. To extend your example, the word ""nigger"" is in all English-language dictionaries, along with usage notes that tell you it is *extremely* offensive to almost everyone. Almost anybody you said the word to would punch your lights out for saying it. The dictionary did its job - it recorded that English speakers use (or used) this word, and it recorded that it upsets English speakers so much that they won't tolerate use of the word. Dictionaries don't make value judgements, but **you should**.By all means, out-pedant me about emphasisers vs intensifiers. But also note that ""fantastically"" and ""incredibly"" are also intensifiers, and their original meanings are ""in the realm of fantasy"" and ""lacking credibility"". Your examples don't show that words meaning ""in truth"" should go on to become intensifiers, because words meaning the opposite have also gone on to become intensifiers.

So they compensate with what they do have, which are throwable projectiles and a super-light super-strong alloy that can absorb energy and reflect it back.  In addition, Wakanda doesn't need to be warlike because they have the cloaking technology to hide, so their weapons tech isn't as advanced as some of their other types of tech.I imagine if this story had taken place in a country in Europe that isolated themselves pre-Eastern contact we'd see a lot of crazy sword and shield technology instead.

"I'm going to devils advocate against Crowder for a second:I think that if you allowed for a rather generous definition of ""Rape Culture"", a rape culture _actually does exist_ on college campuses. Hear me out. At least, up until the recent Title IX insanity, here's what's going to happen. Say you have been raped, assaulted, or otherwise have a credible accusation. You go to the school administration (your first mistake!) over this. What do they do?Obviously, rape is really really bad and the school administration wants to prevent it, stop it, and bring consequences on the predator. But... there's other factors.Maybe it turns out that the accused is from a very politically well-connected family, and if you pursue action against hi, his parents make trouble for you. Maybe his cousin is a major donor to the school, or he is a star student in sports or academics and has a really great reputation that the school gets to enjoy by proxy. Or maybe, maybe the school just wants to keep their risk of reputation damage to a minimum.It doesn't really matter the specifics. The fact remains that _*the university's priority is to protect the university, not the students*_. The university is working with HR bureaucracy incentives: make the problem go away as cheaply and quickly as possible so we can get back to business as usual. Often times, and _especially_ in more ambiguous situations (everything from regret-sex to he-said-she-said situations), the easiest way to do that is to take the bare minimum token action so the victim feels like you did something, and then sweep it under the rug. No investigation that makes rumours spread, no spooky increase in rape stats for your campus, no potentially making powerful people mad. Just Make It Go Away. If you're someone who is actually a victim, and you actually want justice, and you go to the administration, and this happens, you could be forgiven for believing that this is representative of a ""rape culture"". From your perspective it sure looks like _rape happened and they didn't care_. But in reality it's just a natural consequence of the fact that bureaucracies follow incentives and the university has some very strong incentives hanging over it, much stronger than one hysterical freshman.But I would argue that it is absurd to call this a 'rape culture'. Even if the situation I've laid out means that it is literally true that there is a culture that covers up rape, it is still incorrect to call that a rape culture. Why? Because 'rape culture' has a connotation that this is about rape specifically, and that it's at least partially intentional. In fact, the situation is actually caused by a higher level, more general thing, for which the rape scenario is just one of many consequences. If anything, it's an ""incentive culture"" or a ""cover-your-ass culture"".Of course, the fundamental cause of this whole scenario is a mistake on the part of the victim: Why the _*fuck*_ would you go to _university administration_ over a _crime_. The university administration is NOT fair and NOT neutral. They are in fact heavily biased in favour of ""whatever costs them less time, money, and effort"". They're NOT your friends. The university administration solves problems for _the university_ and sometimes the problem (to them) is the victim who won't drop the issue. All of this, ALL OF IT, is trivially solved if people do what they're supposed to do and _*report crimes to the police*_. For an analogy, imagine an HR department at work. Imagine you have a problem with someone at work. Doesn't matter what it is. Do you report them to HR? What if the problem is that this other asshole is constantly muttering insults under his breath towards you. Oh, also, this asshole has been here for 15 years and singlehandedly saved the company from bankruptcy. And you started 3 weeks ago. If you go to the HR department they're immediately going to think ""oh, seriously? The veteran employee _saved our company_ and this dipshit who hasn't even been here for three years can't take a joke about it? We have to get the newbie to shut up before the veteran gets pissed and quits to take that job at Google we know he's been eyeing"". They want _the situation_ to go away but that is not the same as solving your problem.The absolute best case scenario for you going to HR is that HR brings in the senior guy and tells him to knock it off. And now he's mad. He knows that you narc'd him out to HR for the things he said and now he's pissed. Out of spite he'll give you terrible performance reviews and you'll never get promoted. He'll make even snarkier comments but always in a way that's plausibly deniable. By going to HR over this, the only thing you did was make your problem worse.You could look at this situation and say ""SEE, THIS COMPANY HAS A HARASSMENT CULTURE"" but that's not true. Actually, this company has one guy who is kind of an asshole, that everybody kind of hates, but also the company realizes that there's some unpleasant realities about the world that can't be escaped. If you're the victim in this situation, you could spent your whole life getting bitter over it and complain about how corporate america has a harassment culture. You could see your career stagnate as you spent too much time complaining and not enough time doing your job. You could turn into a pathetic shell of a human being. Or you could man up, take some simple and commonsense actions to stop the petty jokes (eg maybe avoid him in the hallway), and if the behaviour is sufficiently severe, go to the police over it.

If it takes 8x the woman attempting to have the same numbers of deaths as guys (assuming 2x higher attempt rate in women, and 4x higher actual suicide rate in men) then the only logical conclusion is theyre crying for help.Are we absolutely sure that is the *only* logical conclusion? I think it is certainly the most obvious one, and one that should not be easily discounted, but *only*?> it is impossible for the researchers to actually understand the intent of another person, even if they do have some kind of evidence to understand their intent (E. G. Questionnaires) that is also not very helpful as it would require the replyees to not be free lying about a topic they would likely be lying aboutCorrect, the researchers that have rejected the ""cry for help"" explanation likely do it based on simply believing the respondents. Furthermore you are right about the liklihood of lying.>it doesnt matter. Why? Men are dying at 4x the rate, thats what matters. Those are the figure that matterIt does matter. Bluetarg said:>>>that urban legend about women attempting suicide more oftenWhen none of the responses have justified that as being false at all. If that was indeed false that would mean suicidal ideation is not something that has specifically female-gendered factors that may need addressing from a mental-health perspective. Just because it isn't an woman's issue from a mortality perspective doesn't mean it isn't an issue from a mental-health perspective.And that matters because this goes both ways.

">	And this is the ultimate point: they aren't dumb or not self aware....they KNOW what they are doing and they don't care.It’s because there is zero repercussions to being a lying shitbag who is only focused on getting what they want and to hell with everyone else. This mindset of bare faced lying and cheating to pursue selfish goals and getting away with it is the tumour of society as a whole. Politicians, corporations, governments and journalists have all begun to realise that once you get past a certain point on societies ladder the benefits of lying, cheating and just generally being a cunt always outweigh any consequences if there are any. To these people things like ethics and morals are a handicap holding everyone else back and the fact that this mindset is being rewarded is just snowballing the problem. People need to realise that life and society is a game of survival. You get one roll of the dice and these people are going all in, taking and doing whatever they can to get what they want and fuck everyone else. Most ordinary people spend their days being nice to people, caring about the environment or the world their kid will inherit. We understand that there are bad selfish people out there but we have faith in the system of society to have controls in place to limit their influence. That just isn’t happening at all anymore.

We have a president, who knows as much evidence as I know about the case, publicly decrying her. So it goes both ways in assuming she’s either 100% true or 100% lying. I’m striking the balance. Part of judging is weight the facts and testimony. I’m saying she was more believable based on comparing the two’s testimony. There’s so much evidence suppressed by the WH and they absolutely continue to handcuff the investigation. And based on SHEER character, BK was belligerent and very wayward. His deflection tactics were embossed by his disgust at being questioned. His inability to cop to things he shouldn’t be lying about (his drinking habits). The fact that even in his own calendar, he marked out a date that listed him hanging out with the very people Ford said we’re witnesses to what she claims.People have been put away for less circumstantial evidence.And again, I think, even in conjecture alone, a testimony like what BK gave would never be believed if he were the one presiding and judging over. No lawyer would ever coach a witness like that. Let alone a judge who knows exactly what to look for. (Source: family of lawyers, many of whom lean right).And again, I think overall we live in a society of victim blaming for many things, not just rape. To designate it a culture is a step to far.

To be precise, approximately 3.05% of boys and approximately 1.57% of girls would have an IQ of 130 or higher in this model.These differences would grow wider as one gets farther from the mean. For example, using the same model as the previous paragraph, one would expect more than six times as many boys as girls with an IQ of 160 or higher.So no, men's intelligence is on average higher, and also more broad.

Has anyone noticed that when something rather unbelievable or ridiculous happens it doesn't matter if it's true the media will just post it up without thinking and it doesn't matter if it all gets proven to be bullshit they will act like they had nothing to do with women like this one getting so famous in the first place?I'm reminded of the Mars scam which I was deeply suspicious of right from the beginning. They were posting it up left and right and when it was found out that the people behind this were just con artists the media instead of correcting themselves just went silent and pretended it never happened or if they did correct themselves it was just one or two articles and that's it.This behaviour is constant and they are largely responsible for the state of things in the west today. They do zero fact checking and as long as it will get them clicks they'll post it up especially if it happens to be something like this where they can peddle their worldview and make it out that anybody who is disagreeing with what this woman did is an evil evil misogynist and the patriarchy is real.,1.0

"I assume you're talking about US history (and leaving aside the gross and murderous injustices of the slave system, which is a book in of itself). Is she aware that voting rights for white men once involved property restrictions? Just as a random example, in Rhode Island in the 1830s, unpropertied men raised a militia and there was violence (Dorr Rebellion). It took decades before property restrictions were lifted for men. It was a slow and unsexy process, so your GF has probably never heard of it.There were plenty of men's rebellions against economic injustices. Ever heard of Shays' Rebellion? Broke out right after the American Revolution in western Massachusetts, mainly poor farmers. Whiskey Rebellion? Poor farmers in western Pennsylvania had one item they could sell-- whiskey-- and the government put a tax on whiskey which was disproportionately burdensome on them. They were not spared taxation because they were men. How about the Anti-Rent War in upstate NY? Poor farmers revolted against a kind of semi-feudal landlord system in the Hudson river valley.Is she aware of labor history? The US had a very violent labor history in the 1800s. Working people (overwhelmingly men) clamored for things like a 40 hour work week and weekends off. Does your girlfriend like having the weekend off? I assume she does. Does she think male capitalists freely gave their male workers days off *because they were men?* Did she read the book ""The Jungle""? Jurgis isn't exactly living high on the hog for most of the book.If you do your homework, you'll see that rights and benefits were never gifted out to common men, *qua men.* There was often a struggle involved. Powerful men do not favor less powerful men. The factory owner is more likely to spend his money on a fur coat for the wife than parcel out benefits to the men on the factory floor. This isn't rocket science.Incidentally, the leaders of the early women's movement at Seneca Falls were all comfortably middle class (at least) and had support from their husbands (oh *and servants,* they sometimes had servants too). For instance, Elizabeth Cady Standon and Lucretia Mott met at an antislavery conference in London; their husbands had paid for their tickets. It is a bit rather hard to claim that you're oppressed when your husband not only buys your steamship tickets across the Atlantic but *also* helps you to organize the first women's rights conference because you had no experience organizing conferences before. Right? If you look, you find all of the early women's rights heroines (who struggled!) *nearly all* of them came out of middle class households of the Victorian era. That was the first large group of women in human history to have free time. Consider the significance of that.",1.0

"So a few important things;> Obstruction is an absolutely bullshit charge. 1) Whenever the police asks you questions, you're expected to cooperate without incriminating yourself. As such, it can be seen as obstruction if you refuse to cooperate, and that is illegal even if we dislike that it is.> You can't cuff someone because they don't want to give you their name... She refuses to give her name and he follows her going ""That's it you're getting dropped""2) Yes, you can. Police has the legitimate mandate to detain people who (actively) interfere with an investigation and/or obstruct that investigation. Does the police need to be as forceful? No.> It's not a crime to have alcohol in a cooler when none of it is open.I am not familiar with laws in the US, nor am I a lawyer. But as a reference, in the Netherlands we have something that's called een ""Algemene Plaatselijke Verordening"" or APV. It translates roughly to ""General Local Regulation"". An APV is used to impose additional restrictions on a smaller area, such as not possessing any stimulating materials and/or alcohol within an area of the city. Should such an APV be applied to the beach, it becomes legally enforceable and you can be fined or arrested. I used to work in a football (soccer) stadium as security, and the entire area around the stadium was under an APV that made the possession of alcohol illegal during the days that there were football events within the complex. As a result, anyone who was found with alcohol either in their hand or carrying it, can receive a hefty fine and be denied access to the stadium.Why is this important? I am sure US law has something akin to that, though I am not clear on the name used. If such a regulation is put into place, ownership of alcohol even if closed and in the cooler would be illegal. Furthermore, by having that alcohol on the beach there is a very high probability that one or more of those alcoholic drinks will be consumed (which would possibly be illegal depending on local rules). No one will bring a cooler with 6 beer in it, and leave it out in the sun to not drink any of them.> Tackles her, rubs her face in the sand, then starts punching her repeatedly while on top of her? I do not condone or accept the violence both by and against police officers. Just do not confuse legality of actions with the interpretation of people on how to proceed. Detaining the lady was an appropriate action, **the method in doing so was not.**Edit:For the record, under New Jersey statute N.J.S.A. 2C:33-15 it is **illegal** for a minor to **possess** or consume alcohol.

"I didn't say they're automatically right.. I said that they're right in this situation. The message of The Little Mermaid is quite literally to give up absolutely everything that you are in order to find ""the perfect man"". Ironically the original fairytale had the exact opposite message, to learn to be comfortable with who you are instead of relying on other people to make you happy. Cinderella was again about how you aren't worthy until you change your appearance and demeanor.What's funny is something like Aladdin which was a gender swap of the same premise, ultimately ended with the message being not to lie, but instead to be yourself.Beauty and the Beast was about legit stockholme syndrome. Fall in love with abusive assholes just because it's better than being single. The hardworking Gaston is considered an ass for all of his negative traits, the Beast, whose accomplishments are a result of birth-rite, does all of the exact same negative shit, but he's considered a good guy.What shocks me is feminists who don't spot these glaring problems, but instead blindly support Disney. ""The Force is Female"" is a marketing slogan, not a philosophy. And where did you get your ""ACTUAL"" feminists? You're talking about extremists.

"Yep, literally every other system in the game is severely underdeveloped. Fun ends right as you realise that there are no significant unlockables, no loot, very basic exploraton of an empty eye candy, and barely any variety or plot. Only the first location of the game isnt empty or boring, and filled with variety. Release state of the game was mechanically the same as early access version from almost 3 years prior (FrankieOnPc did a video on the game at that time, and it looked great, getting regular content patches with new stuff), with 2 added endgame underwater locations and 1 new vehicle. I wonder how long into development they fired their gamedesigners and had to work with what they had. I think it was somewhere near the Aurora exploration patch, because the ship literally has placeholder textures inside, and consists of 4 rooms with drinkable water and empty bags. They even cut the most fun gadget, terraformer, from end release.And after the release, the game got exactly 1 patch, almost 2 months after, despite many critical and still unfixed bugs (you can literally fall through the map at any point).But for some crazy reason this shitshow has an overwhelmingly positive rating on steam, ffs.Edit: just found out they are making a ""stand alone expansion"" to the game, to release this winter.

">Not an argument. Here is a link about the topic- it's Wikipedia but it isn't my job to educate you. You can find primary sources there if you want. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_socialism.  The article reflects what I learned from African students and immigrants I've listened to. This is not even considering BLM, which is explicitly pan-African Marxism. That's amazing.  You do know that Africa is a continent, not a country, and that the cultures vary a huge amount between it's coasts?  Egypt is not South Africa is not Zimbabwe is not Chad is not Cote d'Ivoire is not South Africa is not Mozambique.  To paint all of these things with a brush that says ""socialism"" without addressing how specific countries address it is completely insufficient to form judgement.  To make this make sense to a self-important North American: culture is different in Texas than it is in Seattle.  Lousiana is not the same place as North Dakota.  America is unique in that a huge landmass is considered unified, but the states are unique.  Africa is about 30,000,000 square kilometers in size.  Europe, which we consider diverse as Spain is not the same as England, Germany, Ukraine or Russia, is 10,000,00km^2.This is my issue with your statement about ""African Socialism"".  It's unrepresentative in that there's no unified 'africa' for it to represent.>If immigration were handled responsibly, this would not be an issue. This is the entire point of people who want to see immigration reigned in. We know that people vote in their own interests. Their interests are going to be ""give me as much stuff as possible "". That is how resources in Africa are shared traditionally, which you will learn if you put any work into learning about it. ""give me everything"" is pretty shortsighted and not true of all voters and voting blocks.  Again, I'm glad to see that you view Africa, the 30 million square kilometer landmass as a single, unified country, as though it were, say, France, or Belgium.  It's also a nice deflect of the problems of two-party systems, which necessarily lead to problems like this one - you get a forced ultimatum based on a single aspect of policy.  >It's not long at all. Five years is a single federal election. A million new voters minus the attrition rate as our population shrinks. If you think that this plus their irresponsible optics doesn't benefit the LPC, you're insane. Wow, I can't believe that every single person who immigrates would then become a citizen exactly 5 years after they immigrate just to vote for the Liberals (but let's be real here - it's 2 party bullshit that would have them vote for the Liberals specifically because people like yourself are so adamant that immigrants are literally satan).  When you say ""our"" population, which do you mean?  Does this same anti-immigration view apply to people from France, England, Belgium, Sweden, Latvia, or Russia?  Do second-generation citizens, born and raised in Canada to parents from other countries, not count a citizens even though they have the same birthright claim to ""our"" population as anyone else born on Canadian soil?Furthermore, why does the Liberal party have to be out of power at any cost?  They're problematic, absolutely, but you can pressure the party through public opinion rather than demonize and put another government in power.  I mean, that's what compromise and working democratically mean - discussion, evaluation, then decision-making.  >50% tax rate is still insane. And where do you think the money from the carbon tax and cannabis sales is actually going to go? Do you know what the asylum/refugee employment rate is? you don't hit it unless your personal recorded income is almost $1,000,000/yr.  That's not assets or wealth, that's income.  What's more insane is thinking 1) more than 50 people in canada will reach that amount and 2) that people coming anywhere close to that don't have accounts to work around it.The larger problem is that that tax money is actually useful.  Healthcare, education, municipal maintenance...  All of these public things need to be bought into by the public.  Crying about taxation amount says ""all I give a shit about is that I have mine and fuck you for everything else."">I do if there are too many and they don't integrate before voting. Juding by this thread, apparently 25 years is not long enough to integrate.  Apparently 5 years isn't enough to  integrate, either.>Like I said, mass immigration screws with democracy. Traditional African values are not the same as Canadian values Again, Africa is not a country.  It's a continent.  This is like someone from Nunavut and someone from Mexico showing up in France and the French person says they have the same ""traditional North American values"".>and it is reflected in the infrastructure of Canada vs that in any African country. They believe in pooled resources and equal outcomes. This flies in the face of the reasoning that predicates why the West doesn't look like Fucking Somalia. So do we.  Do you think healthcare and public education aren't a result of pooled income for equal outcomes?  If we didn't give a shit about equal outcomes, we wouldn't have public schools.  Furthermore, how do you think fucking roads would be built without pooled income?  And yet, even with these pooled resources for equal outcomes, we still don't look like Somalia.  Maybe, just maybe, there's more to this.>That means nothing about his cultural values. He was chosen as his current role because he's SomaliCitation please.  The man's been elected to public office twice and was selected for cabinet this time.  Even if he was selected because of his background, how does that in any way invalidate his qualifications for the role?>ergo his identity must affect his decisions. He was raised in a Somali household. If he didn't want to change Canada demographically he wouldn't be advocating for it. To be fair, a lot of the resistance to your views on immigration comes from a hardline ""no immigration at any cost"" stance that seems to be popular these days.  It's also pretty rich to complain about Canada being changed demographically and not mentioning shit like gerrymandering or issues with real estate being used as a bank for foreign billionaires.  It's also ignorant of demographics changing due to industry meddling, like the Irving family in the Maritimes or the loss of manufacturing jobs around the country due to trade deals.  Whether you like it or not, time moves on and demographics will change anyways.>It's a toothless fucking money sink that has done almost nothing of consequence to stop genocide and human rights violations in its most egregiously oppressive countries.

And Poland is a deeply conservative Catholic country that experienced a lengthy period of misrule by crackpot Marxists who spouted increasingly preposterous propaganda  even as the country swirled around the drain for decades.  This history has had a deep impact on the local political culture and the local sense of humor.  Its really different from the bubble the average Kotaku scrivner is surrounded by. (When thinking of such, I always imagine Diane from Bojack Horseman....only \_slightly\_ more interested in video games and sans rich husbands)To the extent anyone in Warsaw is even aware of the latest American SJW cause du jour, the natural tendency is going to be toward mocking the talking points, not kowtowing toward them.But I doubt there is any genuine effort to deliberately offend anyone.

"""men are less likely to seek help...""This is true.  But now ask yourself ""why.""  In the first place, men don't want to bother other people with their problems.   And that's a sublime attribute.   If you can do it yourself--fucking do it.  Don't bother other people.  But sometimes men run out of options.   So who's there to break their fall?   Women?  lol...no.  One woman studied the issue for ten years and reluctantly came to the conclusion that women are...""the patriarchy!""  >What Brown also discovered in the course of her research is that, contrary to her early assumptions, men's shame is not primarily inflicted by other men. Instead, it is the women in their lives who tend to be repelled when men show the chinks in their armor.>""Most women pledge allegiance to this idea that women can explore their emotions, break down, fall apart—and it's healthy,"" Brown said. ""But guys are not allowed to fall apart."" Ironically, she explained, men are often pressured to open up and talk about their feelings, and they are criticized for being emotionally walled-off; but if they get too real, they are met with revulsion. She recalled the first time she realized that she had been complicit in the shaming: ""Holy Shit!"" she said. ""I am the patriarchy!""https://www.theatlantic.com/sexes/archive/2013/04/messages-of-shame-are-organized-around-gender/275322/Now that's pretty troubling.   Does that mean we can't count on women at all?  No it doesn't: if we're lucky we can count on our mothers, our sisters, and our female friends.   Women are actually good at this sort of thing.   But you know what?   Don't go crying to your girlfriend, because your ""SO"" wants you to be a rock.   That's women.   They talk about toxic masculinity, but they don't mean it.  Ironically, our male buddies are probably the best people to discuss problems with.   You may be surprised just how supportive your male buddies are.   :)",1.0

While I think Russia has problems, if you look into Russian geopolitics and their history it's fairly easy to understand where they're coming from and what their motivations are. For example NATO conducts military exercises in Latvia which is right on Russia's doorstep. The US has put defensive missiles in Romania and as Putin pointed out, 'what's the difference between a defensive missile and an offensive missile? It's just the programming.'If Russia and the Warsaw pact was still a thing, imagine if they managed to slowly get Central American countries into the Warsaw pact. Then they start conducting military exercises in Mexico. That'd be quite alarming for people living in America and would put them on edge.The Cold War ended in the early 90's and the USA has acted as if it never went away. Russians are merely trying to preserve their security which includes having buffer states.

"For those who don't know, ""JourneyQuest"" is the name of an indie film series put out by Zombie Orpheus Entertainment, who are also the producers (I think it's producers) of the ""Gamers"" films (i.e. ""The Gamers"" ""The Gamers: Dorkness Rising"" and ""The Gamers: Hands of Fate""), though I believe they didn't become affiliated with the Gamers movies until the second or third such feature. The actual production company that makes the movies is [Dead Gentlemen Productions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_Gentlemen_Productions).I think. The exact nature of how the two companies are related doesn't seem to be entirely clear (that I can find with some casual Googling).What *is* clear is that in the last few films, the content that they produce has started to take on SJW overtones. I know some people here [didn't like the last Gamers movie](https://old.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/comments/6ws40a/had_to_stop_watching_the_gamers_hands_of_fate/) because of perceived SJW-isms, something that I [disagreed with](https://old.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/comments/6ws40a/had_to_stop_watching_the_gamers_hands_of_fate/dmadvol/) at the time.Unfortunately, it's gotten worse since then. ""Gamers Zero"" and ""The Gamers: The Shadow Menace"" (the former being a collection of shorts, leading into the latter film) went full-retard in their support for social justice. Several points include:* Magellan, a wizard who comes to Earth from the fantasy world of Fartherall (and promptly gives himself amnesia), unconsciously uses his magic to influence events in the 21st century. These include his causing the housing crash of 2008, coining the ""ethics in game journalism"" line, and encouraging Trump to run for President.* A new group of gamers includes an openly gay fat guy, who objects strongly to playing Rogar as being straight, despite Rogar being an existing character who is firmly established as being heterosexual. This results in Rogar seducing two male guards during a heist.* An Asian female member of that new group angrily objects to a comment someone else makes that she thinks is ""casual misogyny"" (I can't remember what the comment was).* A black guy in the new group is implied to have had a recent encounter with racist members of law enforcement.

No, let me guess, he's mind controlled by the secret power jews and isn't responsible for his own retardation, as a result.And why do you think JT embraces multiculturalism and globalism?

Because much of the left, Trudeau especially, are parrots and conformists.  It is totally irrational for a leader to celebrate the death of his own nation state by bragging about how his country is the first post national state, but it is rational for a historically oppressed minority who may feel vulnerable to the power of nation state to take comfort in such an outcome .  As I said, there's no conspiracy, just a *disproportionate influence*.

But i mean feel free to keep whining about it, oblivious.>That hurts the Canadians who are already here.  Mass immigration is a means of subverting proper democracy and the Soros types are all too eager to help it along for that reason.Well, no.  Immigrants don't get to vote unless they're citizens, and you can't be a citizen unless you're spent at least 3 of the previous 5 years in Canada, have paid your income taxes, and have a clean criminal record both at home and in Canada.  So how does mass immigration help voting people in, exactly?  Is it a long con?  Furthermore, if it ruins the system, what's the problem with a bunch of new citizens who don't commit crimes, live in the country, and pay their taxes?  How does this subvert democracy more than, say, gerrymandering, voter manipulation through advertisements, or lobbying done by cartels, all of whom are born and raised in Canada?

You don't know how taxes work here do you?I mean, in Ontario, you don't even hit 50% taxation until you're earning $942,562 a year, and even if you earn $1,000,000,000 (yes, a billion dollars in personal income in a year), the tax rate is still only 53.5%.  Hell, you don't even hit 30% until you're earning $115,531 a year.  (https://neuvoo.ca/tax-calculator/)I mean, speak up about the government, but don't be surprised and offended when people call you a retard for saying retarded shit.Moreover, who cares if more Africans come, so long as they pay taxes, don't commit crimes, and actually live here?  How many natural-born Canadians avoid paying taxes and are criminals?

"There's also 2 very distinct groups of Elves. The Aen Seidhe are the ones in the world the books and game are set in, they're very much downtrodden because comparatively they live longer but breed slower, so humans came along and just outbred them with numbers replenishing their losses faster.Then you have the Aen Elle, the Elves from the other world. The ones that make up the Wild Hunt. They're superior to the Aen Seidhe in almost every way. They're fucking huge standing at 8 feet tall or more whereas the other elves are often the same size or smaller than humans. They still have their war machine running and mages that can and will fuck things up.The Aen Seidhe take part in guerrilla warfare because they don't really have the numbers for anything else anymore. The Aen Elle show up on a magic flying boat, freeze everything solid, and then stab anything still moving. Then stab anything that isn't moving. Then set fire to everything just to make sure. If you're lucky enough to avoid all that, they might just take you as a slave to live out the rest of a very short life which will also wipe your memory even if you do somehow get away. They don't fuck around, and they're not to be fucked with. It takes the combined might of the most powerful spellcasters in the world to even stand a chance against them in the games, and the only reason they lose is because you cut off their political support in the forms of reinforcements. If Ge'els was still working with Eredin at the end of W3 it would have been a very different outcome. The Wild Hunt would have killed everyone, taken Ciri, probably then burned down all of Skellige, killed all the Nilfgaardians present which included the Emperor at the time, and then later would have invaded the rest of the world and wiped out everything standing in their way, human or otherwise.There is no good and evil race in the Witcher, that's part of the point. You have individuals or groups that stand out for those points but they don't represent the entire species. Even vampires have morally grey characters such as Regis and Detlaff, which is an unfair enough thing to say since they're not human and have very different ways of living, being very much more creatures of instinct than what humans are.Of the monsters in game most of them are more like animals than anything, killing for food rather than out of terror, and the exceptions to that are often being controlled by something else. Geralt specifically mentions he doesn't kill sentient monsters just because, trying to find a way to solve the problem involving them rather than just stabbing them until they stop moving. There are numerous examples of monster contracts where said monster did what it did because a group of humans decided to start shit in the first place. See the male troll in W2 that's mourning his wife the local humans killed for being a troll, or the succubus in W3 who killed some guards because they attacked her first, or many of the ghosts that are only ghosts because someone fucked them over in life.The single most evil creature in the entire game is probably something so powerful that you quite literally can't kill it. You can trick it and defeat it through a technicality, but that's it. You never in any standing hope have a chance at actually fighting and killing it since it's near enough the actual embodiment of evil in the universe rather than an actual living creature, and what does it spend most of it's time doing? Tricking people into making deals and selling their souls. Yes it can kill, yes it does kill, generally out of annoyance at someone wasting it's time, but despite being actual evil and the most powerful being you will ever meet in the game it doesn't just go around killing everything in sight just because it can. Even the Unseen Elder you can meet in W3, which is probably the second most powerful being in the game, doesn't randomly murder just because it can. You make it a point that unwanted attention on the vampires in general from what is happening would be a problem, despite vampires being so much more powerful than humans and yet it's a point the Elder accepts that point. This is a creature that can literally move faster than even witchers can react to yet it agrees to helping because it doesn't want things to cause trouble, and this comes after you do a quest where you see what just 2 ""normal"" Higher Vampires do against regular humans and you're lucky if you fight and kill 10% of the soldiers there because the vamps just mow down everything without pause. The Elder is above even those 2 in power and it still decides that not fighting is the better option.This is all of course stuff I don't expect the show to deal with. Race doesn't equal species for these people making the show, so the actual racism in the witcher world between humans, elves, dwarves, gnomes, etc will be probably ignored in favour of intra-species racism despite the outright stupidity that suggests when you have both actual different races in the world and monsters which are far more important threats.",0.0

">Yes. If they wish to legislatively enforce their religious moral beliefs, they are Christianists. We've critiqued and lampooned the Religious Right, quite justifiably, for decades in the West. But the Islamic equivalent doesn't get treated with the same scorn.If (and I am not saying you do - but a lot of people who are on ""your side"" of the argument do) you support the movement that is currently holding sway among the ""populist"" right wing - eg Trump fans, the ""alt right""/ ""alt lite"", popular online right-wing/anti-progressive commentators eg Milo, Cernovich, Coulter, the Proud Boy movement - then you are inevitably throwing your hat in with the ""religious right"". It's those people and their supporters that have brought about the state of affairs we have today. And you may call yourself a liberal, or a libertarian, or even a ""non-political person who just wants to play games"" - but by standing in the way of liberalism and progressivism you are enabling those people, and ultimately taking their side in the debate. >Tommy Robinson isn't someone with multiple college degrees. He's not going to speak in an highly precise, polished, educated manner on the subject and it reeks of classism to basically demand he do so. Yes, he knows not all Muslims are Islamists, he knows the distinction and has affirmed it at multiple times.Is it really ""classist"" to disagree with someone because you don't think they are educated enough to understand what they're talking about?That seems to be what you are implying - however in the case of Tommy I don't think he lacks education. The basic fundamentals of the issue are not complex, you don't need a college degree in sociology or theology to understand the principles. Tommy isn't conventionally educated but he isn't stupid, he knows what he is doing. Hence my phrase ""weasel words"". >When we were critiquing the religious right, we made absolutely no bones about citing ""clobber verses"" from their holy texts and pointing out that these stood in the way of them embracing a tolerant interpretation of their religion. We also very rarely brought out huge levels of theological nuance, we rarely took great pains to distinguish between denominations, and we didn't get called bigots for doing so (except by the religious right themselves, whom are not taken seriously).Why, pray tell, is the same treatment some unfathomable bigotry?I don't believe it is unfathomable bigotry. As a liberal progressive, I am quite happy to say that I think a lot of the principles of fundamentalist Islam are utterly abhorrent, and incompatible with modern, liberal society and values. I know for a fact all of my liberal progressive friends would say the same thing. We are quite happy to say that, for example, killing gay people for being gay, forcing women to cover their faces in public, stoning adulterers, etc, are barbaric and wrong. I truly don't know any liberal who would dispute this, or fail to speak out about it. The idea that liberals DO excuse, or fail to speak out over, such issues, is, in my opinion, a right wing conspiracy which is used to muster opposition to the left wing/ progressive political viewpoints. What left wing/progressives take issue with, is right wing political views which imply that ALL Muslims agree with those horrible and totalitarian ideals, and in particular with those that try to say that this ""fact"" means that Muslims shouldn't be in western / non-Islamic countries. You might say that you don't believe in that level of extremism - perhaps you personally are happy for ""moderate"" muslims to live in, and integrate with (while maintaining their own cultural heritage, to the extent that it doesn't impinge on anyone else's freedoms) western societies. But you just need to go and look at comments on, say, Breitbart articles, or listen to the anti-Muslim rantings of Milo or Coulter, to see that the viewpoint that they should be entirely barred from the west (or indeed wiped from the face of the Earth altogether) is fairly established and unchallenged amongst the ""right"". I am open minded enough to be able to see that there are elements of totalitarianist thought on the left - due to the fact that at the end of the day, society needs laws, to some extent, in order to function, and laws inevitably boil down to rights being restricted and freedoms being impinged. However in my opinion the extent of the left's totalitarianism extends to limiting people's absolute freedom of speech, when that speech has the potential to incite hate or harm against others. And issues such as requiring businesses to hire and fairly pay minorities. The extent of totalitarianism proposed by the right - no abortions, no homosexuality, forced repatriation or even extermination of non-whites (again YOU may not believe in this, but from comments on right wing outlets like BB its undeniable that many have these views) are far more horrifying in the extent of totalitarianism that is proposed.

"Ok so this is really weirdThe entire thing about the norwegian flag = Nazi flag thing originates from Germany and east Europe from *after* WW2 as a way for skinheads to get around the 'no Nazi imagery' law a lot of those countries have.

And in either situation it would be bizzare that this person would not know *that it's also the fucking norwegian flag* as in A) I would hope someone in Europe would at least vaugely remember the vexiology of their own continent and in B) the use of that flag makes absolutely no sense without any context regarding Norway and Vikings and all thatAlso that's less of a halfway house and more of a ""nearly completely rehabilitated and just waiting for the jury to say I'm good"" house.",1.0

">If the contemporary right is becoming more liberal, that doesn't mean the contemporary right is changing - it means more people are accepting of liberal values (which the right has traditionally not been). And I fully agree.That's a contradictory statement. If the people on the contemporary right are becoming more accepting of liberal values, that means the contemporary right is changing. By definition.>But, I honestly think you are trying to paint a picture of a new, improved, updated right-wing - accepting of gays, accepting of personal freedoms when it comes to issues such as abortion etc... which at best, is simply a thinly veneered attempt to attract ""new blood"" by throwing out some of the ideas that simply aren't going to wash in the modern world (eg - Milo being ""flamboyantly gay"" - while at the same time taking an anti-gay stance on just about every gay rights issue - such as gay marriage which, even though he has indulged in it himself, he claims should be ""called something else"".)First off, Milo *changed his stance* on the gay marriage issue when he fell in love and got married. He's recently said he thinks the only reason people would deny same-sex couples the right to a civil marriage is pure cruelty. He changed his former stance and admitted it.Obama evolved. So did Milo.Not to mention, opposition to gay marriage *used to be prevalent on the radical left*. Indeed, the radical queer left used to see gay marriage as attempted cultural assimilation, and as the introduction of patriarchal and heteronormative institutions into queer culture. Indeed, it was the work of *gay conservatives and moderates* like Andrew Sullivan and Bruce Bawer that first popularized the idea of gay marriage (read *A Place At The Table* and *Virtually Normal*). Why does the radical left get a pass, with their arguments *not* besmirching or invalidating the left, but Bawer and Sullivan somehow indicate nothing at all about changing perspectives on the right?Finally, your entire argument so far has *systematically ignored the existence of ideological libertarians*. After all, they complicate the simplistic Manichean narrative of ""if you support abortion rights and same-sex marriage rights you must undyingly support the Democrats because All Republicans Are Evil"" you're trying to weave. >You have to admit, the so-called new, ""liberal"" right wing which you are trying to convince me exists, and the old fashioned Bible-thumping, cross-burning right-wing have an awful lot in common - Love of Trump,Trump is the most socially liberal Republican candidate in decades, a thrice-married foul-mouthed philanderer who has publically questioned aspects of the war on drugs and interventionist foreign policy, and who triangulated *to the left* on issues of international economics to capture a traditionally-Democratic constituency (the Rust Belt working class) and thus win the Presidency.Yeah... extremist right wing, huh? In addition, his immigration policy works out to labor protectionism and both Sanders and Hillary wanted more border enforcement too. >hatred of feminism, Equivocation. Feminism isn't a monolith. You can hate contemporary feminism whilst accepting the idea that women should be able to get jobs or live as career-women should they choose. Not to mention there are multiple reasons to dislike contemporary feminism, not all of which are traditionalist... I'm against contemporary feminism *because it isn't anti-traditionalist enough*. >hatred of Islam, George W Bush was frequently at pains to emphasize he wasn't at war with Islam, only Terrorism, and that he regarded Islam as a ""religion of peace."" Not to mention the New Atheist movement was dominated by liberals and leftists yet was quite critical of many aspects of Islam. >rejection of #metoo, Belief in due process and the presumption of innocence is a right-wing position now? Not to mention, #MeToo was started in response to allegations about the sexual misconduct of Harvey Weinstein, and a *huge number of conservatives gleefully celebrated the downfall of a huge Hillary donor*. >belief in traditional gender roles, On this you're mostly right, however by the same token people on the left consistently accuse Men's Human Rights Activists and MGTOWs of being ""right-wing"". Yet both the MHRM and MGTOW are founded on a *rejection* of traditional masculine gender roles. The actual alt-right are traditionalists, I concede that.>willingness to engage in conspiracy theories (Pizza Gate, Sandy Hook being a false flag)Yes, and the left *never* believes in conspiracy theories at all! Oh what fucking rot. Nancy MacLean's *Democracy In Chains* is a left-wing conspiracy theory promoted by a Duke University historian for fuck's sake. Not to mention a lot of the anti-Zionist left is prone to embracing certain unsavory conspiracy theories about ""the Jews."">and, as we're discussing this on a Gamergate subreddit, hatred of Anita Sarkeesian/Zoe Quinn.Yes, personal animosity towards *two particular people* somehow counts as a meaningful and deep political issue that defines the essential characteristics of an ideology. Note the sarcasm.>And if we include Breitbart readers/commenters (who certainly would include themselves, and I don't really think you can exclude them simply because they don't fit your idea of what constitutes the ""new right""), then we can include white nationalism in the mix, too. Guilt by association. Anyone can comment on Breitbart. Not to mention, the editorial line and positions of *Breitbart* are determined by Breitbart's *authors* rather than *readers*. >I could easily have cited Andrew Anglin or Richard Spencer - outright white nationalists.Ahh yes, Andrew Anglin... the guy who declared Holy War against Milo Yiannopoulos. Ethno-nationalism... the ideology that rejects civic nationalism as cuckery, and liberal individualism as a Jewish conspiracy.Please, please let me know how support for a classically liberal civic nationalism built on individualism and the values of the Enlightenment *somehow equates to supporting the alt-right... a movement that rejects enlightenment individualism, civic nationalism and classical liberalism*. >You may say they are different, but they are unequivocally the same in many ways.By the same reasoning I could say that Progressivism is unequivocally the same as Nazism. Pretty much every feature you cite as evidence that people like (for example) Paul Joseph Watson are no different to KKK members is an ideological inessential that has nothing to do with the actual content of a political philosophy.>So it's really just a PR exercise.Just like your posts. You still are in denial that the boundaries of the culture wars have radically shifted. You're still trying to demand that undying support for every excess of the contemporary left be the price of accepting social liberalism. You still seem to think fundamentalist Christians are waiting in the wings even though their influence and numbers are in drastic decline. You still seem to think that the Donkey Party is the party of civil liberties and cultural permissiveness, even though they're using hyperoffended feminists as an army of censorious church ladies and as advocates against due process. By no means would I suggest that anyone who is a ""true"" social liberal should vote straight Republican. There are Democrats who have preserved a devotion to civil liberties and cultural liberalism. It is you, on the other hand, who is trying to reinforce the outright lie that Sex, Drugs and Rock & Roll are the exclusive property of the Donkey Party. ",0.0

So unless you believe that the Canadian system is so shit that she slipped through, she has been going through that in a legal manner and not get deported for it. >> Additionally, the problem is that it's not an accusation alone. It calls for deportation directly, rather than an investigation, which implies that the people posting it consider her guilty without due process.> This is like you saying people shouldn't use the phrase ""break a leg"" as it implies self hurting, which it technically, but you could also stop taking the piss and realize what this is about, she admitted to a crime, we're asking for justice.You are already pinning a guilty state on a person that made a comment and hasn't been charged with anything. You are pushing a narrative that someone **needs** to be deported while she hasn't been tried and convicted for what **YOU** claim she did wrong.She may very well have done wrong and if that is the case then the legal system of Canada will take care of that. It is not up to you or anyone else other than an official judge to call for her deportation or any other form of punishment.

It's not about what she said, it's about how you choose to **forego** legal procedure in favour of vigilante justice through societal slandering and accusations.

I think that rebellious spirit that questions 'why are we going to school?' 'what do we get out of this?' 'how can this be easier?' is a misguided version of the same sentiment that spurs innovation. Engineers are generally lazy, and their innovations are solutions to the question 'how can we do more with less?'. Behind a senior skip day, I see an individual that questioned 'why do we go to school everyday? Why are we wasting all of this effort? If we organize, how can they punish us all?' and acts on those questions by organizing the senior skip day. Do I think that is a good idea? No, but that misguided endeavor was undertaken because of that individual's lack of wisdom. If that individual continues to make mistakes, learns from them and refines their actions to reflect that wisdom gained, but keeps the rebellious spirit to go against the status quo and question everything, I would put my money on that individual to go out and actually make a difference. And sure in that scenario there was a whole mess of people that mindlessly followed someone just so that they didn't have to go to school, but those are just the people that will end up working for the companies that initiating individual will eventually create.",0.0

"Did you read what I said?> I do not condone or accept the violence both by and against police officers. Just do not confuse legality of actions with the interpretation of people on how to proceed. **Detaining the lady was an appropriate action, the method in doing so was not.**Based on the allegations (possession of alcohol by a minor), the officer had all the rights to detain her while conducting further investigation. Should that aunt come by and verify the story independently then the lady would be released with an apology for the trouble. At least, that would assume that the cops themselves are upstanding people. I do not know them, so I can not judge.The fact that she was in possession of alcohol, even if she held it for someone else, is already a problem legally. Under New Jersey statute N.J.S.A. 2C:33-15 it is illegal for a minor to possess or consume alcohol. Any person not of legal drinking age (21 years old) who is caught purchasing alcohol or **is in possession of alcohol in a public place** can be charged with the disorderly person's offense of Under Age Alcohol Possession.It doesn't matter if it belonged to her aunt or not, she was in possession of the alcohol at that moment and therefore in violation of the above law. That these laws are draconic is a very different issue than the one posted here. The lady refused to cooperate with the police, which works against her argument that it is her aunt's alcohol. Why is it so difficult to be polite and cooperate with the police rather than screeching and yelling while obstructing their investigation.Did the police officers do everything right? Absolutely not. But the procedure applied and the actions committed by the police officers do not absolve this girl from breaking the law on underage possession of alcohol. It does not absolve her from obstructing an investigation by refusing to cooperate with basic questions, especially when she's trying to play the ""OH MY AUNT OWNS THESE"" card.So before you tell me that I am wrong, perhaps read your laws first.> It's not a crime to have alcohol in a cooler when none of it is open.Because this absolutely is when the cooler is in the possession of a minor.",0.0

All I’ve said is that his origin concerns Spider-Man in 616, which is the mainstream continuity and the one most commonly pulled from for pretty much every Marvel adaptation. There’s also Ultimate, but Venom in the movie is not even a little bit similar to Ultimate Venom, so that clearly isn’t the case, and Ultimate Venom is even more intimately connected to Peter than 616. Really, I don’t know how far along you got into your high school English classes, but if you look back at my old posts, you won’t find me saying anything about how Venom should be a villain. And once again, I’ve read Venomverse. None of those other characters are Eddie Brock. The Venom Punisher is not Eddie Brock. The Venom Rider is not Eddie Brock. Captain Venom is not Eddie Brock. Old Man Venom is not Eddie Brock.But you know who is Eddie Brock? The main fucking character of that story, 616 Venom, who has history with Peter Parker and whose origin as Venom, the hybrid of Eddie and the symbiote, concerns events involving Peter Parker.Really, I don’t know how to make this any more clear. What other characters do with the symbiote is a non-sequitur and is completely irrelevant, because Eddie Brock is the topic of discussion, not those other characters.Ideally, Venom’s origin story WOULD involve him being a villain, since I guess we’re moving on to this as the topic now, or at least hostile to Peter during their initial few encounters. Because that’s how his fucking origin story plays out.

""For example, did 30% of women leaders lose a war"" does not mean women must have a 70% win percentage. It doesn't count women who have never led a country to war. It doesn't count numbers of wars lost; if one woman loses two wars, it only counts as one. It's possible that out of 100 female leaders, 30 went to war an average of 3 times each with no victories, for a 0-90 win/loss record (all against men, of course). It's also possible that of 900 male leaders in the same time period, all 900 went to war exactly once. 405 (or 45%) lost a war to another male leader. 405 beat another man in a war, and 90 beat a woman, totalling 495 (or 55%).I thought it through, and xenemorph's numbers add up.

Languages change, and just like most changes social and economic influence plays a role.Thing is, those two paragraphs up above would be at best 'informal' nowadays, but I can personally guarantee there're more than a couple things in them that'd have rightly or wrongly been considered improper English just a couple decades ago. (Might've even gotten me called things like 'dumb' and 'ignorant,' too!)In the end, though, all those 'improper' English constructs can nice to have around, because just like our ass-backwards mishmash of a vocabulary in which you have a goose, moose, and mongoose (yet two geese, meese, and mongeese...wait, that's not right at all) and knowing how to pronounce something often depends on subconsciously recognizing which language we stole it from in the first place, they offer us a delightful palette of tone and (in)formality to play with.

"Uh... Hunting in this game? I find tracking thr legendary animals much more fun because there's no way to fuck up the pelt quality. You can just dumb as many shotgun shells as you like in the cunt and the pelt will be just top tits. Standard hunting? You gotta find the animal. Then study it. If it's skinny or sick or too young, no matter how well you do it'll give you a shitty pelt so don't bother, find another that's healthy and old enough. Then you've gotta shoot it, once, with the right arrow, and make sure the first shot is either an instant kill of a near-to-instant kill, because if you shoot it so it won't die straight away you'll fuck up the quality of the pelt or worse, it'll run so far before it dies you'll lose it in the chase. Then you'll get a perfect pelt.Then you got to finish hunting, and get to town quick enough that rot doesn't set in t the carcass (because selling the carcass is what you really want, fuck donating to the camp, I'll just pay for camp upgrades out of my own pocket. The camp upgrades are useful don't get me wrong, I'd say donate until you have the right value to upgrade Dutch's tent, then only donate the bare minimum to the NPCs don't bother you. Only donate pelts you need for crafting.) if you don't sell it quick enough it'll rot and the value will be harmed. Fuck it, do the fake fisherman trick. To get provisions in your camp just buy the meat from a fucking butcher. Now I know that sounds like fun to some people, and there's days I'm in the mood for that shit, too. But if it doesn't sound like your kind of thing? You can functionally ignore the hunting mostly. Just shoot birds out of the air every now and then so you can make arrows, because that's kind of your only silent weapon you can carry a lot of ammo for. At least as early in the game and I am. Fishing on the other hand? **Fuck me** this game had good fishing. And just like hunting legendary animals, there's legendary fish to catch. The first chapter *is* boring as fuck.

But you avoid talking about this, or how the quality of the model is evaluated, and instead try to move the conversation to other topics.Now, looking through the publications page, from the most recent (and thus, hopefully, most up-to-date) publication, the authors state a false positive rate of 0.15.

"I don't see how what's he's saying is a ""holy"" hyperbole.This game has only two strengths - an interesting map to explore and an audio design that makes me nearly orgasmic every time I even think about it.Everything else is mediocre at best.Game is choke full of artificial obstacles and handicaps - classic for survival games hunger, thirst and dumb monsters annoying you on every step and some specific for this game like oxygen, depth, lack of reliable way to kill monsters, stupidly slow movement that is slow no matter what, random pieces of equipment you need to scan, backpack that is tiny for absolutely no reason and etc.Seriously, after just an hour I said ""fuck it"" and turned off hunger and thirst because crawling back and forth again and again between your base and whatever place, because you can carry very limited amount of stuff at once, while constantly surfacing every 30 seconds was annoying enough even without carrying about growing plants and finding water.And few days later I checked out if there is any mods and oh muh god there are mods, specifically there are mods that tries to fix all the basic problem of this game balance - adjusts movement speeds of fins and vehicles, makes inventory size normal and etc. And the expected reply to this is ""duh, it just makes game easier, casul"". And you know what? No, it's fucking not, it makes game playable. Everything that it changes is the awful gameplay loop of ""crawl back and fort 40 times to get enough crap to build this crap"" to ""swim  back and forth 4 times to get enough crap to build this crap"". That's it. It made this game kinda fun because now it's much less irritating. And faster sub is much more fun to use.Now speaking about exploration - what's not ""basic"" about it? You just randomly wander around trying to find stuff you need. There is nothing that makes is much different from any other survival game - the only differences of Subnautica's exploration from Minecraft is that in latter you need to mine to get deeper and its' world is random. You just aimlessly wander around collecting stuff and crafting things until another story event starts, then you go to another drop prod, loot it, get some blueprint and go back to wandering and collecting stuff until another event or until you randomly hit some alien temple or whatever. Thinking back to my playthrough - I seriously have no idea how I made it to the end, how I found the temples, the keys, the fish, the deeper caves and etc. It just happened, like it happens when you find stronghold in minecraft. There is nothing special about Subnautica in this regard, if anything, its' world is actually tiny, pretty empty, has just a few different zones and not a lot of things to find and to do. And I really don't see how>the ship literally has placeholder textures inside, and consists of 4 rooms with drinkable water and empty bags.is not true. There are just a few different rooms that are pretty much copy-pasted and filled with different props. There are just a few objects to interact with on the ship and only a few things to do. And this is applicable to the whole world - it's just a medium-sized sandbox colored into different colours and filled with different props.Of all the places in Subnautica, right now, after ~half a year, I can remember only few ares - ship and your starting crash zone, red area nearby, caves with a tree, caves with giant skeleton, caves with lava and two boring islands...oh, and a cube. I can't remember anything else because there is just nothing memorable in this game. Or because those are all the places in the game, which is not much better.And there is nothing else to do either - you can just collect crap and build crap, like in any normal survival game and try to progress by the story, which is short if you aren't handicaped by the normal game balance. In minecraft, for example, besides those same things I can at least try to build an epic base, full of redstone mechanisms or explode a nearby mountain with TNT. In Subnautica you can...ugh...try to kill giant fish in lava caves with mining mech? (I did it 2 times. Both times it wasn't fun and it was just retarded and meaningless. Also I just remembered that devs said that game has no guns because ""muh violence"" - how drilling something to death is less violent than just shooting it? Idk) Because you can't even build a cool base - building system is restricted by modules and it's extremely dumb, I can't remember what were my problems exactly but I know I had a lot of them while trying to build my cool base. And even more problems while I was trying to build bases in some weird places, like alien temple thing, where you can park a sub. And everything else is this game is just...""ugh"" as well. The only fun thing I can remember is the big submarine. It's actually an ass to control and it's an absolute ass to use generally, without mods, but I had mods and I loved it. But only because I had mods.So, yeah, I don't know if it's obvious enough from my dumb random critique, but this game is an ass that is mainly saved by its' atmosphere (and partially by it's story that is also ends being an ass) which is mainly kept together by gorgeous sound design, pretty graphics and a few interesting places. I hate this game but I think I will be coming back to ride a submarine again and again just because of how this game sounds and how fun the submarine is.*Fixing all the typos and grammatical errors I can find cause it's 2am and I'm a russian bot that can't into proper english.",0.0

I’d like to hear a lawyer’s take on it, but I don’t believe this would count, since he gave them every opportunity to vacate his vehicle. However, if they demanded to be let out once he started driving and he refused, that again would be kidnapping.BUT... That’s where part of my schtick comes into play; if he isn’t in a position to safely let them out—on the freeway, heavy traffic, etc—he could drive for a while (to the next exit for example) and be within the law, for “the sake of safety”.She could be charged with trespassing in this case, I believe. Your personal vehicle is considered to have much the same consideration as your home in some states. It’s not likely anyone would prosecute for this type of nonsense though.Source for my halfwitted/uncertain legal info: I’m a paramedic, and occasionally deal with “kidnapping” issues in the ambulance.

Things change drastically when you grow up and have to work, value and buy your own stuff.

"> Do you think the media as a whole, Internet, newspaper, radio and TV portray worse conditions than actually exist?   I think that there are a lot of people who became journalists for the wrong reason, to drive a personal agenda, and that this is leading to a lot of the divisiveness we currently see everywhere.  I'll start with a comparative example, and then draw a parallel to gaming to explain myself:  One prime example would be when CNN posted that vid of Sylville Smith's sister claiming that she was calling for peace.  In reality, she was telling the rioters to ""take that shit to the suburbs, burn their shit down.""  While CNN ended up posting an apology after having been lambasted for it everywhere, it shouldn't have happened to begin with.  We experience similar things in gaming.  One example would be the firing of two arenanet employees after abysmal behaviour towards customers.  The gaming journalists responded by saying that 'people shouldn't be fired by mob rule.'  Then when Good Old Games published a tweet with the #willnotbeerased hashtag (or however it's written) and shortly after deleted it, those same journalists were calling for the employee that wrote the tweet to be fired.  These kinds of double standards have seemingly become extremely common in journalism as a whole.  Which brings me back to the argument i was making:  ""I think that there are a lot of people who became journalists for the wrong reason, to drive a personal agenda"", these kind of journalists refuse to criticise the side that they emphasize with, and go out of their way to criticize those they consider their opposition over the smallest thing.  As a result, we see a disproportionate amount of claims of sexism, transphobia, homophobia and racism, because to them merely criticising someone who possesses certain immutable traits can only come from hatred of said immutable traits.  > Outside of the competitive scene, players who just genuinely lack skill or time into the game typically see a lot of backlash. My own personal experience was when I started playing Counter strike and league of legends (casual modes)  Just because you aren't playing these games ranked, doesn't mean that the games themselves aren't competitive in nature.  To draw a better comparison you should try to play a game that has both a popular PvP mode and a separate coop mode (against AI).  You' wont get yelled at nearly as much when you are new while playing the coop mode, than you will while playing the PvP mode.  Though there might be one specific exception to this, and that is when you are playing the hardest content in the game, and success depends entirely on every participants contribution.  > When I first started out I was met with a lot of harsh comments followed by being told to uninstall after I just finished the installation. Do you think its sub communities based on specific games that create a narrative of oppression or is it just media?  When they tell you to uninstall the game, it has nothing to do with your gender, skincolour or any other such trait, they just consider you to be really bad at the game.  That said, trashtalking in games **can** be aimed at any such trait, but in most cases that isn't because they actually hate or fear someone over those traits, but because they are trying to get to someone.  Often you'll see that the same person that calls a black guy a nigger in one match will end up calling a white guy a KKK member and a nazi in the next, and then the match after that they'll tell a jew that they'd wished that 'hitler had done a better job'.  This combined with the media's focus on only specific examples of the hostility, and the ability for an obnoxious individual to affect many people at once with their behaviour it's easy to think that this is both widespread and only aimed at specific groups.

"While queer used to be used as an insulting term to degrade gay people it has now started to take it's original meaning again but has now been claimed by the LGBT community. Older LGBT people aren't actually happy with it is like adding Faggot to the list and for many still alive they suffered real abuse while being condemned by the term Queer. Queer in the dictionary means strange, bit unusual or weird or odd. This is why gay men gained the slang term queer as they were strange to heterosexuality in times of intolerance. Now through claiming the word, the Queers are strange and unusual compared to their LGBT counterparts as in they themselves don't fit the existing terms. With the constant need to label and name call in this new gatekept community, a queer can't really be a queer for long before they get assigned a new term.

We may not have seen all the interactions that PC/SW had, they might have already kissed / fucked / secretly married, she may have told the Dwarves about the prince, etc.There's no PROOF that this is sexual assault / necrophilia, merely the possibility exists and can't be ruled out by the film alone.Something lik https://www.alibris.com/Walt-Disneys-Snow-White-and-the-Seven-Dwarfs-Junior-Novelization-Walt-Disney-Productions/book/7114229 might include information lacking in the film which could clear up questions people have on how to interpret some things, I wouldn't be able to tell without reading it.If we go before Disney to http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/5314/pg5314.html it went rather differently>It happened, however, that a king's son came into the forest, and went to the dwarfs' house to spend the night. He saw the coffin on the mountain, and the beautiful Snow-white within it, and read what was written upon it in golden letters. Then he said to the dwarfs, ""Let me have the coffin, I will give you whatever you want for it."" But the dwarfs answered, ""We will not part with it for all the gold in the world."" Then he said, ""Let me have it as a gift, for I cannot live without seeing Snow-white. I will honour and prize her as my dearest possession."" As he spoke in this way the good dwarfs took pity upon him, and gave him the coffin.>And now the King's son had it carried away by his servants on their shoulders. And it happened that they stumbled over a tree-stump, and with the shock the poisonous piece of apple which Snow-white had bitten off came out of her throat. And before long she opened her eyes, lifted up the lid of the coffin, sat up, and was once more alive. ""Oh, heavens, where am I?"" she cried. The King's son, full of joy, said, ""You are with me,"" and told her what had happened, and said, ""I love you more than everything in the world; come with me to my father's palace, you shall be my wife."">And Snow-white was willing, and went with him, and their wedding was held with great show and splendour.In the original tale, my objections are absent. The dwarves are asked, give permission, nothing about the king's son being armed, she wakes up due to accidental dislodging of the apple instead of a kiss. There could still be some elements of coercion with the dwarves, but they are much more active participants and guardians in this case.The wording of KS (king's son) is rather commanding (""come with me ... you shall be my wife"") which I'm sure some people would still have a problem with. Snow has a positive reaction (""was willing"") much as she does in the Disney film, but the issue I think some people have is that one cannot assume the reaction will always be positive to things like kissing/carrying without consent or commanding people to accompany/marry you, even though there are certainly women who enjoy having that done to them.",0.0

"So here's an interesting tidbit in this article:>At GeekGirlCon this weekend in Seattle, six members of the Dungeons and Dragons team from Wizards of the Coast, the company behind D&D, described efforts to go beyond the stereotypes and appeal to more players, including women, people of color and even middle-schoolers. Each worked on the game during the development of its most recent edition, which launched in 2014.The paragraph in question doesn't say who the six women are, but later on is a picture of them, underneath which is a caption:>Members of the Dungeons and Dragons team spoke about their experiences working on the game and its effort to expand into more diverse player groups at GeekGirlCon in Seattle. It then names each of them: ""Left to right: Jaden Emme, Shelly Mazzanoble, Trish Yochum, Kate Irwin, Liz Schuh, Emi Tanji.""Okay, fair enough. But I wasn't familiar with most of those names, so I checked LinkedIn for their work profiles, since I was curious what role they'd played in designing D&D Fifth Edition. Here's what I found:**Jaden Emme:** I couldn't find a listing for her at all, on LinkedIn or anywhere else. I have no idea what her job title is or what role she played in developing D&D 5E.**Shelly Mazzanoble:** Author of *Confessions of a Part-Time Sorceress*, Shelly's bio on LinkedIn says that she's been an Associate Brand Manager at WotC since 1998, and moved up to (non-Associate) Brand Manager in June of 2017. I'm suspicious of the idea that this involved much actual design or development work.**Trish Yochum:** According to her LinkedIn profile, Trish Yochum was a Senior Manager of WotC's in-house Graphic Design Group from 2000-2007, after which she apparently left the company for several other jobs as well as a long stint of self-employment. She rejoined Wizards of the Coast as a Graphic Designer in April of 2018.**Kate Irwin:** Kate Irwin has been an Art Director for Wizards of the Coast since August of 2000. (Presumably this involved D&D and Magic: the Gathering both?)**Liz Schuh:** Her LinkedIn profile states that Liz Schuh has been Wizards of the Coast's Head of Publishing and Licensing for Dungeons & Dragons since August of 1995. Again, I question how much design and development this job involves.**Emi Tanji:** Emi Tanji has, according to LinkedIn, been a Senior Graphic Designer for Wizards of the Coast since 2007, and an Art Director for WotC since February of 2018.So there you have it. Most of the women that were said to have ""worked on the game during the development of its most recent edition"" seem to have been involved with the artwork (which, to be fair, is a perennial hot-button issue for regressives) or were involved with licensing and brand management. At least one (Trish Yochum) doesn't appear to have been involved during the development period at all, unless she was an outside contract. (I don't have my 5E books with me to check.) Either way, aside from issues of the art, this really seems to be stretching the definition of ""involved.""So slightly more honest than normal for typical games journalism, I suppose.",1.0

"When the Cold War ended, Russia stopped flying bombers loaded with live nukes. The USA did not. The USA has expanded NATO into former Warsaw Pact nations to the point where NATO exists on Russia's doorstep. US/NATO strategy of containment is still being used where both Russia and China are essentially surrounded by military bases. Like I mentioned, drills are done in Latvia. Defense missiles are placed in Romania.In the 90's Russia embraced America. They wore blue jeans started listening to our rock and roll. However the Kosovo War happened. Russia didn't use its UN Security Council veto on the grounds that NATO wouldn't use air power to bomb Belgrade. They did. The Russians saw this as a massive betrayal of trust and it's what allowed Putin to rise to power.Russia was supportive of NATO going into Afghanistan. In fact one of Russia's few military bases is on the other side of the northern Afghan border. The supply lines for our troops there came from Russia, and the Russians used their military presence to prevent the Taliban from running north. However Russia opposed the Iraq Invasion, and used that invasion as an excuse to invade Georgia and Chechnya. ""If the US can do it, so can we."" Was their reasoning.In the Obama years when the US, France and etc. did their campaign in Libya, Russia was strictly opposed to a no fly zone so medical supplies and such could be aired in. Clinton said there would be no fly zone. Russia didn't veto the intervention in Libya. What happened? Again the USA lied.Then you have what's going on in Syria. We have had many, many close calls in Syria between the USA and Russia. Dangerously so. You have the perfect conditions for a single fuck up to spiral into WW3. Remember all it took was one guy getting shot to spark WW1. I think the Russians and Americans operating in the area in Syria are likely in communication with each other for this exact reason, so they aren't stepping on each other's toes.I believe that NATO has been particularly belligerent towards Russia. Russia has absolutely no reason to trust us, and I don't blame them when they take matters in their own hands in matters of their own security.",0.0

And I fully agree. But, I honestly think you are trying to paint a picture of a new, improved, updated right-wing - accepting of gays, accepting of personal freedoms when it comes to issues such as abortion etc... which at best, is simply a thinly veneered attempt to attract ""new blood"" by throwing out some of the ideas that simply aren't going to wash in the modern world (eg - Milo being ""flamboyantly gay"" - while at the same time taking an anti-gay stance on just about every gay rights issue - such as gay marriage which, even though he has indulged in it himself, he claims should be ""called something else"".)And at worst (in the case of the far-right) is exactly the same as the old-right has always been.You have to admit, the so-called new, ""liberal"" right wing which you are trying to convince me exists, and the old fashioned Bible-thumping, cross-burning right-wing have an awful lot in common - Love of Trump, hatred of feminism, hatred of Islam, rejection of #metoo, belief in traditional gender roles, willingness to engage in conspiracy theories (Pizza Gate, Sandy Hook being a false flag) and, as we're discussing this on a Gamergate subreddit, hatred of Anita Sarkeesian/Zoe Quinn.

"Someone debunked this guy - and it was Cecilia? What timeline is this?> Picciolini, who describes himself as a “former white supremacist leader,” came onto Kotaku’s radar in July, when he hosted a Reddit AMA. In it, he claimed that right-wing extremists go into multiplayer games to recruit vulnerable demographics into their cause. Intrigued, my colleague Kashmir Hill and I reached out to Picciolini to hear more. We were curious about the right-wing movers and shakers who could fit an entire political pitch into a Fortnite match.> When we asked Picciolini for evidence of his claim and an interview, he referred us to “the many who have experienced the recruitment” and attached a few screenshots of Nazi imagery in open world games like All Points Bulletin. He also forwarded a screenshot of the game Active Shooter, a school shooting simulator, which was pulled from Steam before its release. Another screenshot was from a YouTube video titled “Fag Jews” in which someone named AuTiSmGaMiNg played Call of Duty. It had 11 views.> It’s hard to imagine that the blustering Picciolini has seen enough to make up for the NPR author’s otherwise sparse evidence, and if you have spent any time in an online multiplayer game, you know that some player-made digital swastika is as likely a product of some 12-year-old edgelords as it is of neo-Nazi propagandists seeking to turn the teens to their side. This leads to basic questions: Were any victims of the alleged conversion tactics interviewed? Any recruiters? If this is happening on a large scale, why haven’t any games journalists—and especially ones who spend countless hours each week playing online games—caught a whiff of this wild thing and reported on it?> NPR’s sources, at least as laid out in their report, simply do not provide adequate support for the claim that white supremacists are actively recruiting gamers on multiplayer games on a scale broad enough for anyone to be concerned about it. And to take it a step further, mainstream media publications claiming a clear pipeline between gamers and far-right extremists are buckling into a trope in normie games coverage that simply needs to end if anyone is going to responsibly cover the increasingly established gaming community: parental fear-mongering as journalism. It’s what turned the mainstream conversation around video game addiction into a hot-take circus of bad research and even worse interviewing tactics. It’s what’s completely distorted the scientific methods toward understanding whether violent games make kids more violent. And it’s the sort of thing that, in the ‘80s, led suburban parents to question whether their Dungeons & Dragons-playing teens were literal Satanists.> The NPR story’s author, who is a mother of two, wrote a book this year titled The Art of Screen Time: How Your Family Can Balance Digital Media and Real Life. Reached out to for comment, she did not respond. When I asked Picciolini why he feels confident stating that there is a pipeline between gamers and far-right extremists, he said this:>> “I receive emails or calls weekly from parents concerned that their young sons are beginning to use language aligned with alt-right and white nationalist ideologies, narratives denying the Holocaust or defaming Jews, discussing conspiracy theories related to George Soros.

"This makes me fucking sick and so pissed off.Our 3mo old died from SIDS. We had cannabis in the home at the time of his death. They searched our house for close to, if not over, ten hours. They took my grandmothers ashes that were in a pill bottle (whole other story - aunt is a pillhead) because they thought it was coke?? Bone fragments visible in it and everything. Then the 10month CPS case ensued. They took our oldest and placed him with my parents for 2 weeks until we tested clean. They tested our son twice for cannabis because he was exclusively breastfed, we didn't get his ashes back for about 2months after his death. They tried to put my husband and I in drug court. They denied us. Wanted us to go to a drug rehab center twice a week. Classes were separated by gender. This meant we would have had to go 4 times a week on top of my husband working full time, at the time. We're 30 minutes away from any towns. We demanded someone come to our house if they wanted us to do all that crap. So then we went through about 6 different counselors who came to our house every single week. He passed February 2015 and our case was not closed until December 2015. All because of cannabis. Such bullshit. ",0.0

 Of  all the prejudiced assumptions our society has against men this is the  most insidious.  Our whole culture assumes its impossible for women to  have any sexual interest in children and all men are paedophiles waiting  to strike.   Any men working in this nursery would have been under  suspicion.And the only reason this woman  was caught was because she took these photographs and distributed them otherwise the thought of her abusing a child could never be entertained.   We should spread this link everywhere its critical to challenging the idea of women are morally superior and could never have sexual interest in a child.,1.0
