"To all you idiots who are trying to compare black on black crime to cops killing blacks, please stop. You look stupid trying to make a comparison between the two because they have nothing to do with each other. My tax dollars aren't spent on people in the streets to protect me. My tax dollars are used for the police to protect me. 

And furthermore, black on black crime is no different than white on white crime. People try and use black on black crime like its something out of the norm. White people kill just as many white people as blacks kill blacks. The media won't tell you that though. Crimes that happen within the same race are always higher because the communities in which they take place are primarily made up of the same race of people. It doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure it out.",1
"I haven't read all of the other comments, so forgive me if it was already discussed.  This man bears a striking resemblance to Charles Manson.",0
This guy is a radical rebel FYI and he's part of the ones who massacred innocent lives and is trying to say Syria army and Russia did if. How easy can you fooled AJ+,1

So first of all I even though I use social media I think the guys a dirt bag however he paid for the land which mean the people that had any sort of rights to it got paid so where is all the bitching coming from???? You can't call your land if you do not legally own it... and if it's communal land someone still got paid for it.  There are some unjust things in this world this is just one of them. Also I'm not an expert on Hawaiian law but if they own the land they should have access to it and it's I don't have access to it then They don't own the land....,1
"I'm so sick of society and the image that they are creating for women , it's sad to see so much body shaming these days . Young beautiful girls engaging in dangerous trends to feel beautiful, when they are already beautiful. It's about being healthy not bone skinny . No one should be discriminated against because of their body, looks, hair, it's the heart that makes the character !!",1
"I have small children. I always said as they got a bit older/more self sufficient i would love to foster. Especially older children feeling left out/unwanted.  But this...this kicks it up a notch. I may consider this also. Everyone needs to feel love.
My heart breaks easily, but how can it not be worth it when these sweet children have nothing & just need love?",0

"Once a clown, always a clown. This man is unfit to be president. Anyone and everyone should distance themselves from him. He is as arrogant and pompous as they come.

"Well when it comes to Muslims, then we got a situation, right? When these muslim pigs keep torturing in the worst way christians, what do you say then?probably nothing",1
"There's noone else to blame but our governments, and who actually controls them. Our beloved world is literally soaked in corruption, and this is what it has lead to. When the United Nations speak of ""Justice"" and ""Freedom"", it is all plain and utter bullshit. Do not believe what the UN says, none of it is supposed to help the people.",1
"Cops in Texas are retarded, most of them are thugs with badges ! Racist as hell and can barely do their jobs ,without violating a citizens rights. I feel sorry for any american that drives through Texas, especially if you do not know your rights ! Be prepared to pay out of your ass, for one speeding ticket 2000, in fines. Money hungry cocksuckers will find anything they can, to get you caught up in their bullshit !!",1
"I don't see a problem here, if you have the money the spend it. If black money is involved the government should do its job and investigate.",0
"That's retarded, maybe I should take a napkin, a chip nd a penny on a tour too. I mean everything is considered art nowadays it's fucking stupid.",1
"I'm tired of AJ+ hyping up these stories. The driver lost her job, its obvious the behavior is unacceptable. But whats bullshit is this stupid AJ+ who's been endorsed by paid advertisement normalizing this behavior by sharing it with millions. These guys are among Unilad, and so many, that could post a banana being peeled and it would get millions of views. Embrace the love, and plant a F'ing tree people.",1
This is a shame . These people creating disorder . It is not smart . We all should move on and give a chance to the new president.,0
"Shame on our government for allowing this to continue. But then I'm not surprised, North Dakota doesn't have enough voters, aka: cash donations, to warrant help from the government. I would also like to say, people of color are always treated differently.",0
What's the UN doing? They can go to third world countries and help there but can't help out here. Need partial group to help them stop dapl,0
"What a goddam crime!  If there wasn't any oil in the Middle East, Israel would have never have been 'created' in the land of Palestine, displacing 750,000 Palestinians, killing 10,000 more initially and continually butchering more every day.  Original backing was mostly the Rothchilds working out of Britain.  Now its the USA and Big Oil funded by you, the taxpayer.",1
"American people just like criticize. ...you do good they talk..you do bad they still talk...To govern a country isn't easy,  Obama did his best.. he gone now so r u deal with Trump...wouldn't be surprised if he sell America  as a business proposal haha..that would make history!!!!",0
are they going crazy or some thing they could not distinguish between human and animal bcz muslims arw considerd animals infront of all these crazy people so get them and kill them is only solution how dare they.. 😡,1
"The more I learn about America, the more I hate about their greedy ways. To the white men, enough isn't enough. You have already own territories outside the U.S why must you want more!? You have rob the Native Americans/Native Hawaiians/Peurto Ricans/Carib, Arawak and Ciboney Indians from the Virgin Islands/Chamorro from Guam from their homes and you have strip them from their cultural. Why must you want more?!",1
"America has done nothing for us but a civil war, killing innocents, stealing not only oil because Iraq has alot of great resources, explosions, abductions, sectarianism everywhere, giving a hand to Iran and Saudia to destroy us by playing the cursed game (Suni and Shia) and the most important thing is that the coming up with the scum of the world a group of thieves and greed ppl that all their concern is to destroy the country this group represented by the so-called Iraqi government!! for me as a human being as Iraqi young boy with a foggy future I don't hate Americans at all I like them and I do respect them because they 're humans and we 're connceted in some way, we do carry the message of God that we should love, respect and protect each other and it's not their fault if their government is bad and greed for wealths, but I'm quite sure that there will be a day  you will suffer and died before your actual death like the way we feel exactly nowadays. (The blood of innocent ppl never goes with no punishment)",1
Such a tragedy. Yet another tragedy against the human race. It is so heartwarming to have a human being like Pope Francis at the helm of the Catholic church. Gives me hope and I'm not even Catholic. Now to have a human being like him at the helm of the USA. Or at the very least not an asshat like trump.,1
"America, America,  America.. they call themselves hero but they destroys their peoples culture, life and native people and then saying to our country stop with those judicial killings to our president when their businesses destroys their people's homeland. How hypocrite American government is. To be honest those native Americans are the real Americans. The American government whose stealing lands and killing those nagive people and do it again and again are the real wicked and villains who do it for fheir own greed and selfishness. Thanks to this video it reminds me that I am not still blinded by this government problems of your country hope this natives finds the real justice on their system..",1
"I hate how easy it is for white people to look at these videos and pictures and feel sorry as long as everything happens far away from our comfort zone . How about we all use this fucking white privilege to change the way we think and those that are guilty of these attrocities in the first place because most of this is on us to blame, besides just sitting in our comfort western homes praying for a fucking miracle. I bet most of us europeans and americans would be out in the streets outraged if the images were those of white kids. But oh well prayer might do the job, and hope noone attacks a white country cause then we just love to call airstrikes on these very same people we see here.",1
What can we say. 38 billion US PAID to kill more people. While the entire world fixing their sights on Isis and radicals. The government is funding Israel to kill more people. I smell an operation gonna happen in the region.  GOD be with the people there. I hope I'm wrong. But if I'm right. The red color will appear soon.,1
I hate people. It's too early to call it a hate crime!!!!!! If the shoe was on the other foot everyone would have been a terrorist! this would have been a crime against all of America but let an Indian guy get shot by a white nationalist ... I bet there going to say he's just mental...,1
"I'm not sure what to think about this story... It's pot.. how about you asshats put the guns away for a few minutes and see if you still feel like a man.. violence and death have no place within the cannabis community.. there are other ways to protect your property.. also, I have not heard about any strong arm pot farm robberies... Idk, give these guys free pot and a job working to help people.. not shoot them..",1

"I visited Auschwits in may 2014. I was with a group with a hugely disrespectful girl who claimed it was boring. I lost my temper and said in a stern but quiet voice ""for God sake show some God damn respect"". I was fuming with her especially since our tour guides family members was a holocaust survivor and the fact she had to hear a meme we of our group be like that. I'm sick of people who clearly have no respect like that.",1
All these issues are on the news now because Brazil is going through a great amount of international pressure from financial institutions and political forces. Brazil will nail it!!!

"I hated democrats and Hillary supporters before. Now I hate them even more, you're all disgusting and should be ashamed of yourselves.",1
The question is why wasn't he retried. This cop should be in jail but the system refuses to hold killer cops accountable. They made every concession for him to get him off. The reality is that they're paid to kill POC that's why there's rarely any consequences. Too many thugs with badges.,1
Not against hunting but for the love of God hunt animals that are numerous like deer. Leave these magnificent animals especially rare ones like rhinos over. Good on the people fighting to defend these animals. We need them. Shoot poachers on sight. Make the hunters become the hunted.,1
"AJ+ saying ""all white people are racist"" is a lie? AJ+ normally pushes a racist agenda against whites, this is unexpected. Too bad it falls upon deaf ears as their bigoted fans spew their racist lies about whites and myths like white privilege. Rather than own up to the fact that THEIR bigotry hurts white people just like the racist stereotypes of other races hurt them, they cower behind lies, hate groups like Black Lives Matter, and blaming everything on one man that is nowhere near racist. AJ+, you had a decent start with actually admitting the prejudice towards whites exist, but then you biffed it by ignoring the problem and turning to blame it all on Trump, which is racist and ignorant. Media sources like you are far more racist and bigoted than Trump has ever been. He may be an idiot, but blaming everything on him and ignoring the racism and corruption of Hillary and the left, is downright ignorant.",1
"This was an inside job. These people were killed by their own to stir up chaos and more hate. Mark my words, this charade was planned and executed by their own govenrment in the same way that all incidents, that aim to divert attention away from the elite, are.",1

"This is one white man the native Americans should of skined alive when they stepped foot, wasnt white America built by black slaves?",1
"The difference is that idiots who shoot up a school or theatre aren't acting as part of a larger organisation with a political or religious agenda. There is a huge difference between a large scale killing- like the Sandy Hook school shooting- and even a small scale terrorist attack- like the British soldier who was beheaded in London. The school shooting was done for attention- as there was a lack of any intended geo-political gain- but the man who was beheaded was done in an attempt to begin a Muslim uprising in London. 

It's just not accurate to suggest that any large killing is a terrorist attack and blatantly ignores any definition of the word.",1
"Blowback is a bitch. Maybe the people of France should speak out against their government for sticking their long noses where it don't belong. 
If you want your government and the arrogant rich to keep getting richer through war and stolen resources, than you're gonna have to sacrifice a few of your average citizens. If not, speak out.",1

"it boils my blood how STILL some ignorant idiots think ISIS follow Islam . these monsters are killing innocent muslims in a holy month of Ramadan , how can they possibly be muslims ? does this make any sense ? just because they kill in the name of God doesn't mean they are muslims. if i kill someone in the name of jesus would i become a christian ?",1

"He might be a war victim, but as a Syrian citizen I blame these people for all the death toll and destruction that happened in Syria... 
No matter if these people were aware of what they caused or not. Because before this damn revolution Syria was a country of peace and expected  progress with some freedom restrictions which were getting better. Then these people had extreme radical Islamic mentality, they were greedy for money, plus the nasty interventions of the USA, Turkey and Saudi Arabia. Hence we the Syrian people who believe in our land hope the world could look at our crisis with an objective eye and to restrict its reaction toward special cases like this one since it could be plotted for global sympathy.",1
"Here is what I hate Media gives this awful rendition of everything and everyone, some are true but the majority is just to get a rise out of people! I have Muslim friends, I grew up with a Muslim friend, even though he is Muslim his parents put he and his brother in catholic school and the best part about being friends with a Muslim kid was learning about his homeland, his religion, and how he keeps up with their tradition, like Ramadan. To be able to fast with such power is a clear sign of enlightenment, especially as a kid! He is now a great activist for equality for his people and I have much and utter respect for him and his strive for unity and understanding!",1
"You idiots spouting off about this mans past like it plays any part in the situation at hand is ridiculous. 

Typical behavior needed by the uneducated to make up some sort of moral argument as to why this man deserved it. YOU ARE TWISTED. Victim blaming at its finest. Dredge up the past to try and take away from the issue because you know the issue is messed up.",1

It doesn't treat anything, because when you stop it (only to get pregnant for example) every problem comes back... or not!! Because when you're 16, having painful periods is only part of the process. Don't be mistaken: I hate Trump and all his political choices and ideas and everything that he represents But I hate all the same (if not more) pharmaceutical companies that make use believe all this crap.

India will never progress no matter what tech, bio, engineering, medical etc excellence of youth it raises if the mindset of a certain percentage of its male population including the 'educated' believe it's OK to use, abuse, disrespect, rape, murder or desecrate a woman.

I've ran from the cops in a car before an went to jail for it an as soon as he hit that cop car he can be charged with attempted murder by motor vehicle so it's really not a surprise that they shot him I hate cops but this ones justified.. but everything is about race now so let's make it a black an white thing like every fucking thing else,1

Anyone else seeing similarities with the situation in North Dakota and Palestine????.... And you wonder why Israel has the states on it's side.... Same greedy corporations running both countries!!!,1
"Getting citizenship is not as easy as many of you think. Couple that with the fact that many immigrants are doing jobs that many Americans won't do, for less than what we'd demand, and aren't covered by FMLA, able to get private insurance, and their employers do not have to meet ANY of the requirements of fair pay, work hours, safe working conditions. All of which are benefits we as citizens have. Yet they're willing to work 12 hours a day in fields, construction, meat processing facilities, housekeeping, while making $2.00/hr with no benefits or coverage under labor law requirements. 
When I see US citizens willing to work for the same pay under the same conditions, I'll believe that we as a country are willing to let these people go back. Because without them, your produce, meat, building costs, lawn/childcare are going to go up exponentially due to employers having to pay fairly and adhere to federally mandated rules. 
So don't complain when your lettuce is $2.99, lawncare is $250/month, and childcare is over $300/week. 
We're so worried about how illegal immigrants are taking from us, and what a threat they are, we forget about what an integral part of our society they are. I believe that if you've been here for 30 years, and have committed no crimes, been a productive member of society, you should be granted citizenship.",0
maybe if the governments stop killing innocent people and destroying countries then we can all live peacefully. more armed police = more government control.,1

"Trump is just putting what's currently happening into words, it's not as if what he's saying is anything new it's just that people get pissed when something like this goes public. The United States has for a long time Cared only for itself, not that this is a bad thing but the problem is that it involves other's hardships for them to gain.

I guarantee that nothing major in the US will change except the smaller issues just to make it seem something is changing but the bigger picture remains the same. Changes evolving wage, medical insurance, etc. these are fairly simple problems when you look at the bigger picture but sadly everyone focuses on how changes personally benefits instead of the greater good.",0
"That is untrue. Google search relisha her name relisha rudd turms up many articles.   And you can go onto FBI stats for missing persons every year. Yes certain cases seem to get a lot pf media attention.  It's usually circumstances though not race. In Natalie Holloways case she vanished while on a high school trip in a foreign country.  Her suspected killer walked and killed another girl later her parents were very active in her case and made numerous media outlets twll their story.  In the case of Chandry Levy also a top Google serch, was killed by her scumbag boyfriend politician and he got away with it. In the case of Relisha.  The last day she was seen 2-2614. She was not reported missing until 3-1_14. On 3-25_14 FBI offers 25k reward. Relisha disappeared and the people she was with ""the janitor amd his wife sold her"". Her mother sold her to the janitor.  
Sex trafficking is real and more kids disappear from homeless shelters,  through CPS, churches and the very organizations established to protect them than are even reported.  In other countries parents sell kids to pay debts. It is similar here but not discussed. Remember some one has to report a child missing first. Children run away from Foster Care and a "" parent "" won't report them missing so they can still collect a check for them.
We live in a sick world,  yes independent sick people commit horrible acts. But the bigger problem and the larger numbers of kids "" missing "" are those that society never hears about. We don't want to face the fact that churches sell children.  We don't want to admit that pizzagate is real. I conclude by saying that any child missing should hold the highest priority in our police force and in our community. But they are not. Who is still looking for Relisha?  Even the Holloways and Levy family have had to hire PI and do their own research and yet they still have no answers, no justice.",0
"This Fake Israel is not America's friend, they are the ones who got you in the wars in the first place. And have you now in debt, while they are debt free.

"I use to work in Saudi Arabia, you risk punishment and jail if you are not respect country low such as abaja for western woman to wear, or coverage of tattoo for me for example. The punishment sometimes consist in whipping...in other muslim country as well if a couple go to spend holidays cannot kiss each other in public space! So why we would respect thei rules in their country and they have not in ours? Stop that! If they come in wester country the have to follow our rules otherwose go back as they do with us!",1

"I am with the Native Americans.   Clean water and protecting their land passed down generations is a natural right. Do they (greedy corporations + other greedy political powers) want to steal more? They have stolen way too much already. Too much. Enough is Enough. There is a limit to savageness and greed. Learn from the Native Americans and their ways, how they believe we are apart of nature not a part from nature. We need values like this for humanity to survive and for climate change to mitigate and stop now.",1

Mashallah very good to hear I want other Muslim friends to pay back for great people I am Muslim and I hate terrorist no matter which religion they are... we need humanity more then religion...,1
"I think the reason for the negative comments are experiences of abuse, hearing stories of abuse constantly, and the fact that people from the middle east are painted as evil terrorists. I can understand if an individual who didn't have a happy childhood or didn't have a close and healthy relationship with their parents, especially with their fathers can have this unsettling view of this guy.

 That being said, I don't think this man deserves that kind of attitude or treatment. He's performing a kindness so rare to be honest my own brain had trouble registering and I find that sad. The video even says it, these kids aren't adopted because no one wants to deal with death; to care, nurture, and love a sweet little soul knowing they're going to die is not something a lot of people want to deal with but he's doing it because someone has to care for them. They deserve a warm homemade meal, kisses when they're sad, to laugh and to be tucked in nicely in a soft and warm bed. Even if they're going to live for one more month, and I find it more upsetting that people condemn him instead of realizing how many foster kids have probably died without knowing that love. It's bad enough healthy foster kids  have a low probability of adoption, these sick kids have an even lower chance.
I get it, people have glimpsed evil but I like to believe people are innocent until proven guilty. Personally I don't believe he is a sick man to want to hurt these kids; you don't want attention on you when you want to hurt someone, you want to remain hidden and anonymous and he's fostered 40 kids and buried 10, that leaves 30 children and probably a handful would say something if he did abuse them.",0

I saw Philando Castile civil rights violated and the police officer that killed him is still employed with local government. I've seen Keith Lamont Scott killed for nothing too. I saw Eric Garner killed for nothing. I see a lot of Blacks Due Process right violated and the President Obama did nothing to admonish local governments. Our American government is parasitic.

I wish the situation is reversed so that you can feel what your doing. If you have any left. Your no better that Hitler, actually you are him. And those Palastines are the Jews that he went after.
Survivors of that owe full regime would never agree to what you are doing. 
You don't even genetically belong in that area, non of you do. There are middle eastern Jews and you treat them like second class citizen

Besides it was never the Arabs that wanted to wipe out the Jews it was hitler with his white supremacist Christian thoughts and all who believed and supported his stupid narrow minded ideologies. How many people died? It's not about religion. It's about Zionist having power. Because Palestine was not your first choice was it. It was a country in South America right??

You ""as a pretend nation"" if you where legal opposition would not have lasted, you rule unarmed ( except with stones and pebbles, stop demolishing 1000 year old homes and graves there would not be that many stones) civilization.

Where are your or all that support you in the world are going to hide from your creator?? 

Really, God told you to kill everyone you killed in the world. 

You were once the chosen ones, only because Moses (PBUH) was beloved to him and was calling to the one and only. And the Pharo needed to be stopped...

God created humanity not so that the Israelis to take it.

Let's see how it will feel being on the receiving end.

Nothing to do with religion. Unfortunately by this video you only see what they want you to be seen. Those children are very easy to abused as they can't speak for themselves.

You all can say what you want but u can't call someone racist bcuz we want to be considered equal. Why can't we focus on this particular post and the fact is white girls are more publicized when missing than any other race and that is a problem! The fact is we shouldn't have to make our own seperate websites or news stations just to get the info out but that is what we have to resort to bcuz we are not considered equal in the eyes of this country...period,0

Now this is what you call blatant and shameful propaganda -_-. Most of the rebels who controlled East Aleppo were members of Al-qaeda and it's allies like Ahrar-al-sham. This guy must be a psycho if he was happy to live under the boot of Al-qaeda cut throats in Aleppo.,1

I can't believe how this channel portrays the people of my country and how biased they are when it comes to Aleppo and the fight in the city, always portraying the rebels as innocents and the government as the perpetrators.

If you've been in this country for 15+ years I feel what you contributed to society should be the only factor in deciding if you should stay ... Americans have never had to immigrate to another country because the u.s is so huge they can just move to another state... we don't have the experience yet we determine the fate of illegals. If they are good people who have done nothing but take care of their families then deporting them makes no sense give them a warning ⚠️ tell them they have x amount of time to file their paperwork but literally grabbing them out of the life they lived for years is pointless I'm not sure how the u.s benefits from deported good hardworking people,0

Here's something else - AJ+ is owned by the Qatari network Al Jazeera and their biased agenda bleeds through every post they make. The alt right is stupid and so is this white nationalist retard. Duh. Everyone who has the least bit of intelligence knows this. Why are you so bent on focusing on racism AJ+ ? You are so one sided it's disgusting.,1

If rebels are not ISIS, who and how do they get their funding and ammunition from? 
And if this is a propaganda, where is the other story? I only see coverage of people killed and shunned.
It also intrigues me that those (vlogs) all came out all at once as if it was organized in a call to send a message, BE it a message of sympathy or a message of propaganda.

It really is hard to tell what is actually happening, but one thing is for sure, the Syrian citizens are murdered by all parties and this war should stop!",1
"There is alot of people angry about the election and I understand you are upset. But there is nothing I hate more that rioting, you are throwing a tantrum. Most great things that this country has accomplished has been through peaceful protesting aka: wemon right to vote, blacks right to vote (Martin Luther king). (Might not be great in some oppions, the prohibition). When you riot you are ruining regular people's lives such as: small business(that you distroy), hurting people, and wasting your own $$ believe it or not so tires, trash, property you are burning someone is going to pay for it YOU THE TAX PAYER (if you have a job) you are just hurt yourself and the people around you.

Lets pretend neither of them are rapists, but they both had some cases of sexual misconduct.

""b-b-but Europeans came here illegally first!"" They couldn't have come here ILLEGALLY if there were no LAWS to break! Their were no nation states in the Americas before the Europeans arrival, no rule of law, only tribes ruling over what land they could take or conquer from other tribes.

"So angry and sad at the same time. 

After Rigiberta Menchu and Michelle Bachelet, Dilma Rouseff inspires my life and contributed to my personal beliefs and politics. 
She overcame prison time, torture and rape under the U.S. backed Brazilian dictatorships. Years later, she became the first democratically woman President of Brazil. 
Today, Dilma was ousted via parliamentary vote (parliamentary coup) by the U.S. right wing politicians and the business elites. 
The defenders of democracy (U.S., Obama, Hillary) turned a blind eye as usual. #UShypocrisy 
I'm trying to be positive, I look forward to Dilma's comeback. The day will come again when she shames all the rich, oligarch, racist Brazilian men back to their neo-colonial White Supremacy caves.

And by the way, if justice was on the ballot then Hillary would be in jail right now, not pardoned for who she is. I have lost respect for this guy. This country's priorities are out of order, we build highways and infrastructure in Iraq and Afghanistan the so called terrorist countries while we don't have clean drinking water here. We provide 38 billion in aide to Israel including universal healthcare and etc while veterans here in the states don't have the support they need and commit suicide.  We allow corporations to raise prices of much needed medicine to unaffordable prices. Nothing is wrong with making money but 1000 percent more then any other country just seems wrong. And schools are definitely not on the ballot because our children are not advancing like much of the world. President Obama may go out as one of the best president of all time(I voted for him twice) but when you dig deeper we really haven't made much progress.

If he was a true practicing Muslim he would believe that anyone not willing to convert to the religion of Islam should be murdered. Therefore he's just an Arabic guy living in freaking England.
